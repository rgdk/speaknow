So a person who has been balancing both from childhood, that is their studies and their entertainment, will find it much easier to maintain their personal and work life. You can achieve this balance by making timetables, setting a time period of how much you should be working and what time you should give yourself to take a rest or go out, enjoy with friends.

Conducting exams just for the sake of it, a lot of portions that needs to be covered will be covered in a short time span and then the students will just go by heart the same information and come answer the exam.

So instead of rather giving, rather making them write the same exact thing, a lot of different concepts needs to be tested. Even in oral exams, people need to be given the skills to talk in front of the class, to give out their own opinions out loud and a lot of debate competitions need to be conducted where students can come in front openly and confidently talk about a lot of things.

I think they can both go hand in hand the internet can't replace obviously the The interaction because the librarians and the people in libraries they help they help with what you're like in order to If you tell them what you want, they'll help you to go to certain sections where you can actually find it and The library or some ways that the library can remain relevant is I think that they should adapt certain Digital approaches to like I said Scanning books and then keeping them in a digital format so that it's easier to find them and then also for Students to be able to find the books digitally Yeah, thank you",16,1483.3878586923906,1229.994833765284,784.5413166109354,0.0,5976.989853145605,-16.9747,21.956467,4947162.0,2053.0129403428114,1644.511446126849,1680.96,0.08020553,0.14187791990012527,0.5653136864754428,0.0539375,0.24025612472160357,1.830314246685307,68.4,0.5703017711639404,26.888339181286558,7.252865497076019,43.49630434782609,1

They are very interested in where they have come from, where we originated from, what has happened in the past that has made us what we are right now. So I think that people are intrigued by the past because of, now for example, the Taj Mahal. The fact that it's such a beauty, it's such an ancient monument but it's still so beautiful and people keep coming and looking at it because of the story behind it and what an important thing it was for one person to dedicate this ancient monument to as a gift to his wife. There's a story behind that and the fact that people want to know what it's about and it's also like being in touch with your past in order to make sure what your identity is right now and also in the future. The next question, do you need to put special effort into protecting ancient things? I agree because you need to respect your heritage because you need to be proud of where you came from. For example, I'm from India and India has a very rich heritage and there's a lot of temples, monuments, like I said the Taj Mahal and I think all of that needs to be protected because that just shows where we come from and the values that we have as Indians. So I think that it's very important.

There are a lot of facets to address, but I guess I would say if I were the Minister of Education in the current country that I reside in, some of the changes that I would make would primarily be to expand the access of education for all children and to make quality education more affordable. There is high quality education available, but I find that that's limited to a certain segment of society and really you want all people in a society to have equal access to quality education as that improves the society overall and also make sure that you don't have any segments that are perpetually disenfranchised or unable to reach their full potential. I actually think that that would be my priority. I would like to lower school fees, I would like to lower the cost of books, I would like to lower the cost of uniforms. I think that people regardless of their financial background or their family standing should have access to the same high quality of education. While I think that it would be common sense or easy to make decisions such as that, you have to realize that there are differing opinions and varied moneyed interests that are always going to be involved in any system, whether that be healthcare, transportation or education. So you'll have to contend with different viewpoints and different interests.

What makes me happy about the present situation in the country that I'm in is that each year there seems to be progress.

I guess what I mean to say is that you have certain climatic events like tornadoes or hurricanes, and those have existed for as long as we know, but the crisis is caused when these come into conflict with human civilization. A hurricane that makes landfall where there are no homes isn't really a crisis. So it's really a combination of not just the events, but these events happening in places where humans have decided to make settlements. It's not really a matter of responsibility. I think this is just the way that things are on earth. The way that we can overcome some of these crises, though, I believe would be better planning. There are some areas that are really not suited for inhabitants, whether that is the coastline, which is subject to erosion and vicious storms, or if we're talking about building settlements on steep embankments in countries that have prolific rainy seasons, which often end in mudslides. So I think we may be able to manage our settlements and our habitations a bit better. And I also think that there is some significant work we can do with stopping climate change.

If you're talking about drawing and painting, I think it's very difficult, we need to learn it, we need to spend a lot of time to be a good drawer and painter. I don't think I'm good at drawing and painting and I feel like it's quite boring to draw and paint, moreover, it's hard to keep those kind of stuff and we need to buy different kind of stuff so we need to spend more time than just to take pictures. Basically nowadays I keep my pictures and photos in my phone and my laptop or the drive. Nowadays we have this special package from the website like Google Drive or something which we have tons of space to keep the photos so it will be easier for me to keep the photo there and also it is safer than anything else. We can keep it for a very long time, we can share it to whoever we want and we can look it back if we have free time or want to revise our memory.",13,1180.5013282490218,798.2831037536885,931.130289599373,0.0,5412.504307020283,-18.8791,28.772352,11199228.0,1316.004431792952,1317.549184737402,1408.4147,0.051296335,0.06473297458763912,0.7924297475971784,0.080625,0.34181240063593005,1.7979235760094388,36.75,0.587864339351654,14.475833333333338,5.75455782312925,19.660858208955226,0

That's why I think it's much more enjoyable than studying my language. I need to study English since in my country, they like value the second language that you know in using in the work environment. For example, if you want to be an English teacher, you need to know how to use English. Pretty good, right? So, I think this is very crucial to me that I need to study English. Moreover, I want to go abroad. So, basically for foreigners from every country, they must know how to use English in any countries. Because I think it is not the second language for each country. But I think it is the global language which every country need to use it to communicate in any context that they want to talk about. I think English is kind of 50-50. I think it's half difficult and half it isn't. It depends on our practicing. The more we practice, the more we know about English. And we need to spend a lot of time either way. Moreover, we need to have a good mentor or tutor or teacher in order to correct our mistakes. Because we are not perfect. We are human beings. We are not perfect, right?

Probably, it's going to be better to make it more practical by probably using some sort of tools that can measure their brain or something. When it comes to choosing the betterment of the exam, I think it depends as well. For some, I think it's going to be the written exam.

So the poor might see it as a very unfair society that they are currently living in. So of course in order to become transparent about that we should try to narrow the gap and then maybe the society could create employment especially for the unemployed or those who are poor like try to provide them with jobs instead of let them be unemployed. And the government needs to make sure that there is a very stable political society. Probably like there is no unrest in the country that they are living in.

But nowadays, with the advance of technology, for example, we have the internet where the students can get access to and do their own research. So somehow it could help lighten the burden of the teacher, like the students do not have to rely a lot on the teacher. And the teachers will also feel less pressure, for example, in terms of marking and doing assessment or giving assessment to students. In the past, they would have to do it manually, like marking the students' paper and stuff, but now maybe they can just assign a link of the exercise and maybe they can post it in a digital platform and let students complete it by themselves. And it just automatically marks by itself, so this could help the teacher to reduce their paperwork. But I also believe that there could be also the drawback of the technology, because we have robots and we believe that one day the robot will replace the teacher.

But if you live in an apartment, it will be definitely a bide one and of course you will get a lot of benefits with your apartment like there can be more safety security guards and also you have neighbors to interact with. But living in your own house, you will be alone without any neighbors, without any kind of community. Also in apartments, there are a lot of facilities which are not possible in house.",5,1397.0690389750816,961.1375433717835,1078.9897383205941,0.0,5917.145975111362,-24.70012,31.48697,18471642.0,1645.6831883490247,1340.7141537824382,1894.3284,0.058562066,0.08412469502699335,0.6961340708245134,0.0580625,0.385797342192691,1.7527703054973112,17.444444444444443,0.5818473100662231,7.673205944798301,5.536305732484074,11.534663536776215,0

During that time, children can easily learn any language without having to put in extra effort. However, after 15, that becomes really difficult. Thus, I think elementary school students should definitely learn foreign languages in high school.",2,716.2970111449234,515.927114893954,627.8862947294461,0.0,5969.18798195031,-26.035261,26.42498,9390590.0,966.6151238243647,994.8735942585658,1032.3549,0.14333402,0.06261993640744061,2.288951800769461,0.038,0.2725235320484088,1.8379762642126316,20.88888888888889,0.5225741863250732,11.072624113475175,10.712978723404255,17.438091503267977,0

And also you can know how to communicate with others who have different kinds of personalities, characteristics other than yourself. But there are certainly drawbacks too. For instance, if you encounter bumping into someone who don't fit with your personality, for example, if someone is too introvert and reluctant to communicate with others actively, then she might feel very stressful and sometimes be freaked out in the middle of the conversations with other colleagues.
