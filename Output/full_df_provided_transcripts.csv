However, I am of the opposite opinion. I don't think that you can judge a person based on just one meeting. I think that you have to see a person in a multitude of various contexts in order to see what they're like in different situations before you can really get a whole picture of the person. Uh Just as an example, I could think of people that I work with who may seem a bit standoffish or reserved, but that's just their office persona. You meet them outside of work in a more social setting and you get to see them more comfortable and come alive. And in fact, find out that the person that you thought was a bit rude or dismissive or condescending is actually quite warm, affectionate and affable once you get them in the right context. So it's, it's really not a great idea to judge someone based on the first impression that you get of them.",12,1412.2727060640977,1234.1114743130177,760.2795007600948,0.0,5436.401542348594,-13.311285,28.599243,12342382.0,1831.8281336209818,1558.068349622977,1681.7742,0.06043635,0.12677368092967384,0.4767263119516208,0.0266875,0.24868957483983692,1.8063001276853345,25.375,0.5765740871429443,9.884575123152711,5.771428571428569,14.848695652173916,0

Uh I would say that the three most critical components in no specific order would be salary. Uh passion and location. I mentioned salary obviously because you need remuneration for any job and the remuneration needs to be commensurate with the lifestyle that you want to lead. I would say that passion is important because it's really hard to continue with the job that you don't care about or that doesn't really appeal to you. And then I would mention location as well. Uh I mentioned it last, not because it's least important, but being able to access your job site conveniently and quickly, actually, I think improves a worker's overall job satisfaction and it doesn't matter how good the job is.

There are a lot of facets to address, but I guess I would say if I were the Minister of Education in the current country that I reside in some of the changes that I would make would primarily be to expand the access of education for all Children and to make quality education more affordable. Uh There is high quality education available, but I find that that's limited to a certain segment of society. And really you want all people in the society to have equal access to quality education as that improves the society overall and also make sure that you don't have any segments that are perpetually disenfranchised or unable to reach their full potential. Uh I actually think that that would be my priority. I would like to lower school fees. I would like to lower the cost of books. I would like to lower the cost of uniforms. I think that people regardless of their financial background or their family standing should have access to the same high quality of education. Well, I think that it would be common sense or easy to make decisions such as that you have to realize that there are differing opinions and varied moneyed interests that are always going to be involved in any system, whether that be health care, uh transportation or education. So you'll have to contend with different viewpoints and different interests. And I do think that that could make uh finding or achieving a resolution relatively difficult, even for some of the most common sense solutions. What makes me happy about the present situation in the country that I'm in is that each year there seems to be progress. We're not really where we need to be just yet.

One would obviously be the climate and the second would be the humans who live on this earth. Um I guess what I mean to say is that you have certain climate events like sorry, certain climactic events like tornadoes or hurricanes and those have existed for as long as we know, but the crisis is caused when these come into conflict, sorry, conflict with human civilization. Hurricane that makes landfall where there are no homes isn't really a crisis. So it's really a combination of not just the events but these events happening in places where humans have decided to make settlements. Uh It's not really a matter of responsibility. I think this is just the way that that things are on earth. Uh The way that we can overcome some of these crises though I believe would be better planning. There are some areas that are really not suited for inhabitants. Uh whether that is the coastline which is subject to erosion and vicious storms, or if we're talking about building settlements on steep embankments in countries that have prolific rainy seasons which often end in mudslides. So I think we may be able to manage our settlements and our habitations a bit better. And I also think that there is some significant work we can do with stopping climate change or not so much stopping climate change, but maybe making a significant reduction in the speed of climate change by reducing our usage of fossil fuels, namely.",20,1655.1722620022808,1456.705647413742,887.1334873487654,0.0,6378.286228804451,-15.144154,30.746246,16069793.0,2031.4905414197078,1609.499143842635,1711.9049,0.053746037,0.13636417978817655,0.39413603534798775,0.053125,0.27384020618556704,1.8063001276853345,23.833333333333332,0.5364215970039368,10.827377622377622,8.225594405594403,16.272544529262085,1

So um international media allow, allow people to um see what is happening outside their own country. Like local media is good, but international media could just open people's eyes to the outside world, could expose them to what is happening like in terms of political, in terms of um so social, in terms of technology use, like see what the world is like. And this could help people to be open mind, to be open minded, to accept the new changes. But uh it also could have the disadvantages because somehow we are exposed to something that is not very useful or something that is harmful to our society. Um Maybe somehow we adopt uh the wrong idea because maybe different country, they have different um situations. So somehow what we see from the other country could not be applicable to what we could do in our own country.

First of all, let us talk about um how technology has helped the student. So in the past, most student rely a lot on the teacher, like in case that they have any question they would ask the teacher. But nowadays, with the advance of technology, for example, we have the internet where the student can get access to and do their own research. So somehow it could um to have like turn the burden of the teacher, like the student did not have to rely a lot on the teacher and the teacher as well. Um Also feel less pressure, for example, in terms of marking and doing assessment or giving assessment to student. In the past, they would have to do it manually, like marking the students uh paper and stuff. But now maybe they can just uh assign uh a link of the exercise and maybe they can post, post it in um a digital platform and they still then complete it by themselves and it just auto automatically map by itself. So this could have the teacher to um reduce their paperwork. But I also believe that there could be also the drawback of the technology because, um, we have robots and we believe that one day the robot will replace the teacher. So somehow, uh, the teacher could be in a dangerous position of losing their job of the, the job in the future.

Um, they will be, they will receive punishment, for example, maybe fine of 10 or $20 if they are found to not wear the helmet. So actually the rule is good.
