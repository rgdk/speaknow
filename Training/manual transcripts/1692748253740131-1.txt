A lot of people believe that you can judge a person accurately based on their first impression that they make on you. However, I am of the opposite opinion. I don't think that you can judge a person based on just one meeting. I think that you have to see a person in a multitude of various contexts in order to see what they're like in different situations before you can really get a whole picture of the person. Uh Just as an example, I could think of people that I work with who maybe seem a bit standoffish or reserved, but that's just their office persona. You meet them outside of work in a more social setting and you see them more comfortable and come alive. And in fact, find out that the person that you thought was a bit rude or dismissive or condescending is actually quite warm, affectionate and affable once you get them in the right context. So it's, it's really not a great idea to judge someone based on the first impression that you get of them.
