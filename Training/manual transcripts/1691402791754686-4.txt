In the last summer, our family take the cruise eh, to Greece and eh, it was very, very hard for us because we can't go down eh, through two days. It was very difficult to be in the closed place without, uh, without ability to go to the ground, always on the sea. And, uh, and when we get to Greece, it, er, we were allowed it only for several hours to go down. It was very difficult for us.
