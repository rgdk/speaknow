I think that environmental crises are caused by, by two primary factors. One would obviously be the climate and the second would be the humans who live on this earth. Um I guess what I mean to say is that you have certain climate events like sorry, certain climactic events like tornadoes or hurricanes and those have existed for as long as we know, but the crisis is caused when these come into conflict, sorry, conflict with human civilization. Hurricane that makes landfall where there are no homes isn't really a crisis. So it's really a combination of not just the events but these events happening in places where humans have decided to make settlements. Uh It's not really a matter of responsibility. I think this is just the way that that things are on earth. Uh The way that we can overcome some of these crises though I believe would be better planning. There are some areas that are really not suited for inhabitants. Uh whether that is the coastline which is subject to erosion and vicious storms, or if we're talking about building settlements on steep embankments in countries that have prolific rainy seasons which often end in mudslides. So I think we may be able to manage our settlements and our habitations a bit better. And I also think that there is some significant work we can do with stopping climate change or not so much stopping climate change, but maybe making a significant reduction in the speed of climate change by reducing our usage of fossil fuels, namely.
