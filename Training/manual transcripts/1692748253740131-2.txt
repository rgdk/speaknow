I think that there are several significant factors that a person should consider before selecting a job. Uh I would say that the three most critical components in no specific order would be salary, Uh passion and location. I mentioned salary obviously because you need remuneration for any job and the remuneration needs to be commensurate with the lifestyle that you want to lead. I would say that passion is important because it's really hard to continue with the job that you don't care about or that doesn't really appeal to you. And then I would mention location as well. Uh I mentioned it last, not because it's least important, but being able to access your job site conveniently and quickly, actually, I think improves a worker's overall job satisfaction and it doesn't matter how good the job is. If you spend an inordinate amount of time or money on fuel to get to that location.
