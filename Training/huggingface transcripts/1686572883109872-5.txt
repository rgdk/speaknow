I DON'T THINK THAT CELEBRITIES LIKE ACTORS OR PROFESSIONOR ATLETS SHOULD BEHELD THE DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR AND COMPARING FROM THOSE OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC BECAUSE VEA ALL HUMANS ANDD WE ALL HAVE A HUMAN RIGHTS SO I DO BELIEVE THAT WE ALL SHOULD BEHELDD TO THE SAME STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR EVEN THOUGH THAT THOSE CELEBRITIES ARE WELL KNOWN AT THE HALF WAKE A LOT OF FALL OF OF EARTS THEY SHOULD SHOW A GOOD EXAMPLES BUT STILL I DO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ALL HUMAN WE ARE ALL THE SAME AND THE STANDARDS SHOULD BE AND SIMILAR FOR ALL OF US
