I THINK THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT A PERSION SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE SELECTING A JOB AH I WOULD SAY THAT THE THREE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENTS IN NO SPECIFIC ORDER WOULD BE SALARY A PASSION AND LOCATION I MENTION SALARY OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU NEED REMUNERATION FOR ANY JOB AND THE REMUNERATION NEEDS TO BE COMMENCEMENT WITH THE LIFE STYL THAT YOU WANT TO LEAD I WOULD SAY THAT PASSION IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD TO CONTINUE WITH THE JOB THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT OR THAT DOESN'T REALLY APPEAL TO YOU AND THEN I WOULD MENTION LOCATION AS WELL A I MENTION AT LAST NOT BECAUSE IT'S LEAST IMPORTANT BUT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR JOBSITE CONVENIENTLY AND QUICKLY ACTUALLY I THINK IMPROVES A WORKER'S OVER ALL JOB SATISFACTION AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW GOOD THE JOB IS IF YOU SPEND AN INORDANT AMOUNT OF TIME OR MONEY ON FUEL TO GET TO THAT LOCATION
