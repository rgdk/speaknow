YES I DO THINK IT IS BETTER TO HAVE MANY BROTHERS AND SISTER THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING MANY BROTHERS AND SISTER IS THAT WE CAN PLAY TOGETHER AND GROW LEARN AND BE FRIENDS YOU CAN NEVER FEEL ALONE WHEN YOU HAVE MANY BROTHERS AND SISTER BUT THERE ARE ALSO ADVANTAGES OF BEING A ONLY CHILD YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL STUFFS WITH YOUR OWN SIBLINGS ALSO YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU CAN YOU YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SMALL FAMILY BECAUSE IT IS MORE MANAGEABLE AND IT WILL BE GREAT FOR DEALING EVERYTHING WITH A SMALL FAMILY
