A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN JUDGE A PERSON ACCURATELY BASED ON THEIR FIRST IMPRESSION THAT THEY MAKE ON YOU HOWEVER I'M OF THE OPPOSITE OPINION I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN JUDGE A PERSON BASED ON JUST ONE MEETING I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO SEE A PERSON IN A MULTITUDE OF VARIOUS CONTEXTS IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT THEY LIKE INDIFFERENT SITUATIONS BEFORE YOU CAN REALLY GET A WHOLE PICTURE OF THE PERSON I JUST AS AN EXAMPLE I COULD THINK OF PEOPLE THAT I WORK WITH WHO MAY BE SEEM A BIT STAND OFFICH OR RESERVED BUT THAT'S JUST THEIR OFFICE PERSONA YOU MEET THEM OUTSIDE OF WORK IN A MORE SOCIAL SETTING TAN YOU SEE THEM MORE COMFORTABLE AND COME ALIVE AND IN FACT FIND OUT THAT THE PERSON THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS A BIT RUDE DISMISSIVE OR CONDESCENDING IS ACTUALLY QUITE WARM AFFECTIONATE AND AFFABLE WON'T YOU GET THEM IN THE RIGHT CONSECTS SO IT'S IT'S REALLY NOT A GREAT IDEA TO JUDGE SOMEONE BASED ON THE FIRST IMPRESSION THAT YOU GET OF THEM
