I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEE LIVING IN A HOUSEHOLD AND LIVING IN AN APARTMENT SO ACCORDING TO ME LIVING IN A HOUSE IS NOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN LIVING IN APARTMENTS IN MY COUNTRY HOUSES ARE MORE COMMON THAN APARTMENTS I LIVE IN A HOUSE I WOULD PREFER TO LIVE IN BOTH A HOUSE WILL GIVE YOU A FEELING OF YOUR OWN OWNERSHIP BUT IF YOU LIVE IN APARTMENT IT WILL BE DEFINITELY A BIDE ONE AND OF COURSE YOU WILL GET A LOT OF BENEFITS WITH YOUR APARTMENT LIKE THERE CAN BE MORE SAFETY SECURITY GUARDS AND ALSO YOU HAVE NEIGHBOURS TO INTERACT WITH BUT LIVING IN YOUR OWN HOUSE YOU WILL BE ALONE WITHOUT ANY NEIGHBOURS WITHOUT ANY KIND OF COMMUNITY ALSO IN APARTMENTS THER ARE A LOT OF FASTILITIES WHICH ARE NOT POSSIBLE IN HOUSE
