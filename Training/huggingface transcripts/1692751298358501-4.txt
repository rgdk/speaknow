THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EDUCATION AND MY COUNTRY IS HERE THE PUBLIC EDUCATION QUALITY IS LOWER THEN THE PRIVATE EDUCATIONWIL QUALITY THOUGH PRIVATE EDUCATION IS EXPENSIVE BUT THEY DEDUCATE A LOT TOWARDS YOUR CHILD FUTURE AND THE EDUCATION THERE IS FAR MORE BETTER THEN THAT OF A PUBLIC INSTITUTE ALL PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL COLLEGE ARE SCHOOL SO ACCORDING TO ME I THINK THAT PRIVATE EDUCATION IS BETTER I WILL DEFINITELY SEND MY CHILDREN TO PRIVATE EDUCATION SYSTEM YES IN MY COUNTRY PRIVATE EDUCATION IS VERY POPULAR
