I'M TALKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCESS BETWEEN LEAVING IN A HOUSE OT AN APARTMENT O IN A HOUSE IT'S MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAN LIVING AN APARTMENT BECAUSE WE GET A HOMELY AVIVE FROM THE HOUSES AND APUDMANS WE SHARED A LOT OF NEIGHBORS WHICH CAN BE A DISTURBANCE TO EAT AN EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE AND THAT NOW I LIVE IN A HOUSE I THINK I WOULD PREFER HOUSE BECAUSE I'VE ALSO STAYED AN APARTMENTS BEFOR RECH I DIDN'T LIKE BECAUSE OF THE NOISES THE DISTURBANCE AND ANY OTHER FACTORS TO THEREFOR I WOULD PREFER TO LIVE IN A HOUSE
