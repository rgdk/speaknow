Um no, I don't want to be on a reality show. And the main reason why is because I really want to I really take care of my privacy eh I don't want the people all around me, especially outside of my neighborhood or my city or at work. I don't want them to know about me any more than what I want to give or to show I prefer to leave it like that and to make my friend and my way on my way.
