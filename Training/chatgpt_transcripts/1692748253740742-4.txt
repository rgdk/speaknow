I agree that there's a phenomenon that, you know, lots of children are being educated at home. I think this is because of the COVID pandemic, in which, you know, people have to be socially distancing from other people. And I think it could be because of the threat of bullying. Some people choose to school the children at home rather than, you know, mainstream education institutions. And this brings benefits and, you know, harms, for example. You know, as a parent and teacher, you can ensure your children's safety. Children don't have to travel. If parents work at home, they have the flexibility of arranging the class time and, you know, working at the same time. But the disadvantages are students or kids don't learn social skills because there's only one student in a class, which is themselves. And they don't have interactions with other people.
