I prefer to be most remembered for my great wisdom, not my great kindness. There are several reasons for this. First, I would like to contribute to the knowledge and to enable to help people to overcome some problems and I need wisdom, not kindness, in order to accomplish that. Second, I think people will appreciate more people that contributed to the humanity in general, to all human beings, rather than just being kind. Because being kind is restricted to one period of life and contributing to knowledge is something that can have effects for several generations.
