I was in trouble with a friend of mine. I really don't understand what happened between us. She was angry about me and she didn't say anything to me. So she shared her thoughts with other people and I heard that she disagreed with some of my ideas and I really feel bad about this because she never talked to me and she never decided to share with me her thoughts and never said to me that she disagreed with me. So the result is that we are not in touch with each other anymore.
