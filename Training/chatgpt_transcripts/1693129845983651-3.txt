Wow, I can't believe it. I speak like for two minutes without pressing the recording, so I will start from the beginning. I said next week my child going to, for the first time in her life, to the kindergarten. It is very scary, but also very happy for us because it will be the first time that she will get in interaction with other children. I think it will motivate her to speak and to interact and play with other children, which is very important for her development. Also, as I said, it's a very scary period because kindergarten is not always safe for the children, and we want to give her the best, and we don't know what will happen in this, you know, almost all day she will be there without our inspection. So we hope for the best. We hope that the team will be very warm and very protected for her, and of course the children and the environment will be very safe and happiness.
