Young people should live on their own by the age of 20-21 by the time they graduate. And I think this is my opinion because by the time that they graduate, I think they are, you know, an enough adult and you know, they are in enough maturity to take their own life decisions and live with themselves. And it's really an essential part that they, you know, they live with themselves so that, you know, they can know what they are and they can take further life decisions for themselves. Most people in my country would not agree with that because an agreeable age to live with, you know, live without your parents is when you're 25 and for girls, it's when they get married. I would definitely would want to start living on my own when I graduate by the age of 21.
