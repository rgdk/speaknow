There are a lot of cultural events that happen throughout India. India is a diverse country and there are a lot of culture. So around my place or in my community, there are a lot of cultural events too that occur every now and then. There have been, during Diwali, there have been a lot of pujas that people join together or they light diyas in the temples. They collectively join together to light diyas where all men, women, children dress up and come join this puja. Also during Navratris, certain places conduct dandiya competitions and also it's where people dress up and dance garba. They do garba and a lot of other people join together. The one that I like, the cultural event that I like is the garba competition or the garba dance that I was talking about. So here people, the last time I attended this competition or this dance was I think last year during Navratri. We had to dress up in the lehenga choli and then around 6 o'clock they start the garba where we all join together. Everybody, men, women, children all come together. They play a certain music to which you perform to the steps as they indicate. It's a very fun event after which there is also a dinner that is given to all. People have good food and have a great time there.
