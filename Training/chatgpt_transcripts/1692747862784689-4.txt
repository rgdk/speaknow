Children shouldn't have works for the weekends, because they spend enough time already studying from Monday to Friday and many hours a day. Although having homeworks at weekends can help many people academically, but it doesn't change the fact that children would still be cheating on the exams, and they still copying other people's homework. But for me personally, I don't really think students should do homeworks on the weekends, because they should have more free time, so they will feel refreshed after the weekends, and especially help them to have peace in their mind.
