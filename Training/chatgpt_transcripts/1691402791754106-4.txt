I think my best teacher was the VP of Engineering, Moshe Tchetchik. He was very good at his job. He was a very good engineer, very good VP. I learned from him to go to a problem and be very analytical about the steps I need to do to get to the cause reason, the cause of the function or problem that I have in the instruments. He taught me how to write a deviation report to do a report about the reasons that cause the problem. He taught me how to both live my life and have the right ratio between work and home. He taught me how to ride the bicycles, mountain bikes. I learned a lot from him on how to do mountain biking.
