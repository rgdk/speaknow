This was a challenge for me back in my 10th grade with myself. I challenged myself to remove the fear of stage frightening which back then was a huge thing. I had to do, I had to take part in a competition for emceeing so I did it and then it was challenging because I was really scared of a huge crowd and I was scared of talking in front of people so it was very very challenging. Yeah, you know I did it all alone. I didn't ask somebody for help.
