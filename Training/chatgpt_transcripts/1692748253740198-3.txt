Well, currently the internet in my country is relatively expensive comparing to the neighboring countries like Thailand and Vietnam. And for the people, the access to the internet is different or varies from city people and people in the distant remote areas. I mean in provinces, especially in remote areas that they have very low access to the internet. However, people in the city, because they have better living standards, so the access to the internet is quite simple for them. I'm well considering with my happiness or my satisfaction with internet service. Because I actually like streaming videos, games, and also uploading videos on YouTube, so I need a faster internet speed. However, the internet speed in my country, if I want a kind of high speed one, it costs a lot more. It costs an arm and a leg to do it. But in the, I really need a proper one, I just pay like 18-20 dollars per month. But I need a fast one, I probably have to pay a hundred dollars, which in comparing to the ones in developed countries like Korea, South Korea, and US, it's still quite low, much lower than them in terms of the speed. So I'm kind of a little bit happy with what I have now, but I would be happier if the internet speed or the internet service companies could provide a bit better speed, and especially with the maintenance, they could, if there's something wrong with the internet, we call them for the customer service, they could come to my house and get it fixed as soon as possible. But unfortunately, it took time, even just last week, it took time for them to come and get it fixed, so sometimes I have to search on YouTube and fix them by themselves, or ask my friends who are the experts in the internet or the information technology to help me solve the problem personally. So not, yeah, yeah, quite.
