The transport problem that are there in our country is mainly the road problems and traffic that are working. Like example if I am walking in Bangalore then it will take for me around 3 to 4 hours to reach 10 km so traffic should be clear and the system should be clean. People should take public transport during the rainy season. People should avoid roads. So according to me we should change from road transport to mainly public transport and because of this there will be less traffic and less people will be there and less jam. I usually prefer public transport because it is eco-friendly, cost-friendly and less money and more people can accommodate.
