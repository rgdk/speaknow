Okay, so I was very happy in the summer, like two years ago. It was summer 2021, because I successfully passed my driving license and it was a category license. It means that I can drive a motorcycle. It was like the dream come true because I always thought that those people who are driving the motorcycles, they look like some kind of superheroes. So it was like one of the best things that happened in my life when I successfully passed the theory and practical exams from the first time.
