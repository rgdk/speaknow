It's quite hard to answer for this question. So there's kind of emerging changes in my country regarding the Ministry of Education in Korea. So I would like to change, if I were the minister, I would like to change to reduce the times of a whole for students because there are great burdens amongst Korean students. They even study until like after 9pm and 10pm and I think it's very insane situation. We are in the very insane situation. So what I'm going to put my priority on is to give them freedom to choose what kind of subject they like to get in or choose to follow their own motivations to study. And I think this would be very difficult for me to realize to make renovations and new education systems because traditionally parents eager and strive to give their children lots of knowledges and information as much as possible so that they can enter into a better college and get better jobs in the future. So I have to face very unseeable obstacles in the future. So the things that make me happy about the present situation is that things are getting changed and people are considering to change the traditional ways of education.
