Well, something that I would do differently is to study harder in my vacation and also throughout all the trimester of this year. Because I had a plan of studying really hard to improve my English, but I'm not doing it because I was lazy and also because there were a lot of homework. But I think that's just an excuse. If I do want to study hard, I can because I have a lot of time. So what would I do about it? I would probably just be studying harder, studying more diligently from now on. Why would I do it? I would do it because I really want to get into a really good university. Another reason is that I want to be an interpreter, so I think it's important to improve my English. How would it be different from what you did before? It's a huge difference. So I think if I were practicing my spoken English and I were reading a lot of English articles, I would practice my writing and also practice my listening. I wouldn't feel difficult for this exam and I can get through this exam really easily and contently. But that's not what I'm feeling now, so I think it would make a big difference if I had done things differently.
