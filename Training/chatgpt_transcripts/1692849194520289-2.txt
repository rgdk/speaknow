Yeah, um, cautious. When I do my assignment for my university grades, I am going to be cautious because I want to get more grades and I don't want to make a mistake. That is the main reason that I am going to be cautious. So, um, do you think you made a lot of choices? Am I? Yeah, absolutely. Let's not take a risk. Cautious is the best way to live a life for me because as I told you, I don't want to make any mistakes. When I make a mistake, I regret all day and it makes me depressed. So, just first of all, I don't want to make a mistake before I regret. Yeah, so that's all. There are some mistakes that could not be fixed or arranged. There's a lot of, yeah, we can find a lot of examples in the world that we couldn't fix. Yeah, so, um, before made a mistake, should be cautious is better than better to me.
