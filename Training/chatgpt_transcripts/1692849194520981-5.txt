So, that's another tough question to be answered. And I think we all take responsibility for the occurring climate changes and climate crisis we are facing at the moment. So, the government and big tech companies such as Google or Apple can be responsible for these detrimental results of climate change because they consume and produce high amount of carbon dioxide to the air. And I think that to overcome this biological crisis, we have to consider the way of sustainable method to produce energy. And maybe we should take into account to make some electronic cars as people trying to do at the moment. And I think that the rising awareness of the crisis of the environment is also one factor we should consider highly. Because more and more people, I think, as far as I'm concerned, don't care throwing their trashes just on the streets. And they don't try to do actually realize and make some progress into their own actions. So, I think that the government should teach the citizens, teach the people to make high awareness about the situations. So, it will be one way we can solve this problem we are facing right now.
