Like, a lot, really a lot, like a one hour a day using the computer and the social media. I think it's good because they really need the kid's password because you don't know when someone is going to try to scan your kid, or like trying to fraud yourself. When the kid use the internet in a bad way, it could affect you too, because if they have your credit card, they could use it to scam you. Yes, I think so, because parents should see what the kid is doing. And also, it's a good idea that your kid has a lot of time in their bedroom using the cellphone. But I wanted to go outside and see the cell. It could be seen in a bad way, but yes, it's true. The people in our days, it's like just missing the point that we have to go out and just have the life that we have and just be happy with it.
