Speaking, nowadays people don't speak to each other, they usually communicate with other people through whatsapp, through messages, most of the people. Because it is easier to speak to people through whatsapp and chats, instead of going directly and speaking, communicating directly. But speaking is very important because it helps us to develop a relationship between other entities and it helps us to create a network. For example in business, speaking is considered more important than chatting or messaging. Because most of the businesses are done through face to face.
