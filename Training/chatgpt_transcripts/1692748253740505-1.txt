One of my favorite story is listening to my friends talking about her daily life at her workplace. There's many types of story that she have told me whenever we meet. We normally meet at a coffee shop for a few hours in order to talk to each other. She always tells me about her story, her daily life, something that she has encountered, and many things else. I really love to listen to those stories because some stories could be my inspiration for my everyday because it's really good to listen to one story.
