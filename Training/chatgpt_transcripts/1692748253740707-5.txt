I have a friend. We started together when we were 18 years old. That time I was in Yuen. And her name is Bukit. Well, she is so funny. And yeah, she is always so funny. Well, it is so crucial for people to stay in touch with each other. Any friends who are away from you? Well, we can stay in touch with each other and update to each other about any bad day or any questions that we all have in mind. Recently, for reality, the only way that people can keep in touch with such friends is using social media platforms such as Telegram, Messenger, and other platforms that people can use. At least things that are convenient for them. And well, another way is that people can come and visit each other. Like come to Cambodia or come to any place such as coffee. Well, that's all.
