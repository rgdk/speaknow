I believe that in the world there is not just one source of knowledge. However, there are actually a lot. And one of the best ways to obtain knowledge is through the real world experience. By working or doing things in the society, I believe that a lot of people would actually get to experience and understand what works look like so that they can actually learn more about the tasks or any activities that have been assigned. Because the knowledge written in the book also derives from the real experience itself, that means that the knowledge taken or done in the real world is much more valuable.
