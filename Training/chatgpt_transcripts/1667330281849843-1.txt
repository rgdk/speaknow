I would much rather be a first version me than a second version someone else. Why is this? Because I feel that throughout the years, the accomplishments I've made, the studies, my academic degrees, my studies in Israel and abroad, my skills, professional experiences, and maybe possibly personal challenges have definitely been something that has made me who I am today. I am proud of what I feel I have accomplished and honoured and thank God for who I am today.
