Yes, absolutely. That is completely good idea. You know, as Kiosk emerging, I saw a lot of examples of people couldn't order and other people get lose of their confidence because of the accessibility of machines. I can understand them. That is quite difficult to adopt, especially for a lot of people. So, government, such as council, to most help them to adopt that technique and machine and computer. That is the role of government. That is the reason for why government exist. Actually, a lot of people need computer techniques in a lot of cases, such as internet shopping or some lectures or browsing and searching some useful information for themselves. Yes, so, as young people doing, elder people need computer but they just couldn't because they hadn't enough chance to get familiar with computer machines. So, maybe there are some fee or payment. I'm willing to go on Instructure for Comfort Club. Yes, that will be good and I'm happy with, I will feel happy with that task for elder people.
