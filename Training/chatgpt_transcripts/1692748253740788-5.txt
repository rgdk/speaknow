When talking about recycling, not many people know what it is. I mean they know, but they don't really know the importance because Cambodia, let's say the old people, elderly people, they did not get good education when they were young because of the poor regime and because of the war. And now teachers start to provide good education to the young generation so the kids learn more about recycling as well. However, there is no, let's say, encouragement from the government. The government does not play any role in helping them to know the importance of recycling. What we look at nowadays, people start to recycle because they know some Vietnamese people walking along the street with a cart to buy all recyclable materials like they say, etchai, etchai. So when they walk along the street, they will buy used papers, used cans, bottles, so that they can sell to etchai and they bring them to Vietnam to make them into a new material from the recyclable materials. So I think Cambodian people know about recycling from Vietnamese etchai, the dealer walking along the street with a cart to buy the used materials from people all over Cambodia. So thank you so much to Vietnamese people who started recycling ideas in Cambodia.
