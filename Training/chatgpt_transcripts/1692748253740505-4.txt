But from my own point of view, it is not really difficult for children to study at school these days because it is in nature already since the child needs to go to school and then they can get more knowledge at school compared to virtual class that they can stay at home and study online. The children go to school have more benefit for them. And I think the parent and teachers can make the school more easier for children by they can do it by having more extra activities so that the children can learn in a better environment. It is like having fun while learning when comparing to the virtual class they can only study at home and just have a discussion with their friends and it is not really that fun coming to school, comparing to coming to school.
