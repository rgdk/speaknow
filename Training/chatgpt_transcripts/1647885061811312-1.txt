I would be happy to go to the past and meet my ancestors in order to ask them about things that I have in the current time. I think there are several benefits of going to the past rather than going to the future. One of them is the ability to see things that we miss, our parents, our grandfathers, and people that we just saw in the family albums. And to see them, it's a great pleasure that we can, in this occasion, ask them questions that we always want to ask them. Yeah, that's the reasons.
