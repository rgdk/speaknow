Of course, I like reading. I always read when I have free time from my work. I try to read books a lot because it's really important to me to read a book. And yes, I always get books from the library because I can change a lot of books that I want just by paying for the member of the library. And yes, I try to read as many books as I can. Just people in my country like reading books. A lot of, mostly of them like reading books. And they are always go to library to borrow book or reading book in the library too.
