I think the issue of environmental crisis is not an issue where you can point fingers to each other and say that so and so person is responsible for a particular crisis. Environmental crisis is a wide topic. Some or the other person is, in some or the other way, responsible for some sort of environmental crisis, almost sort of like a butterfly effect. But I do believe that while the population does things that necessarily might contribute to environmental crisis, the bigger burden here is on the major corporations that do not follow the rules and regulations required. I mean, I as a person might leave my lights on in a room for one or two hours, and that might contribute to the environment in some or the other way. However, it is definitely not comparable to the amount, to the vast amount of industrial exploitation to the environment going on. So I think this is a matter in which we should not point fingers to each other, but rather take steps equally. And bigger people should take bigger steps. So the major corporations should take bigger steps to overcome this particular environmental crisis.
