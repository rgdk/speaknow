Well, in Cambodia, I think that science subjects or STEM subjects are very popular because right now we are moving into the digital era so people are promoting more and more STEM subjects and there are also many competitions for young kids, for young students, teenagers to compete in the STEM area. And I think the reason that make a subject popular or less popular is according to the era we are into so now we are living in the digital era so of course the STEM subjects has become more and more wide known, more popular than the other subjects. And what makes a subject become less popular is that people ignore those subjects, they don't give value to that subject so it becomes less and less popular. I think it's like there's a trend when many people are into one particular subject and promote that subject more, many others feel like oh they should study that subject too in order to make the subject be more popular.
