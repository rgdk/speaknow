The most important school subject I think is math. I think it's very important. Math can be used everywhere that we want. It can almost help you a lot. Math is very important because all the subjects at the grade 1 to grade 12, it always help in the book subject. Until university or work or salary, they have to have a math to use it. I think math is not very difficult. I think math is very easy to study because I studied from grade 1 to grade 12. So I know it a lot. But I cannot say it's very easy. Sometimes it's not easy too because when I grow up and meet a lot of math, I think it's hard to do it. The people, maybe a little lot of people like to study it because sometimes when we study it, we feel make them feel bored and sometimes headache. Yes.
