I would recommend Eco-students as someone who is working hard, having very good learning attitude and also being very useful in class, but also at home. I think there are things that Eco-students should do. For example, participate in class, helping each other. Join in school campaigns or maybe projects. And also be a good person, I guess so. So when someone is a good person, that person will naturally do good. And also perform well in class, I guess so. I think there are not many good students because I did not have a chance to help school or teach other students, such as doing projects or maybe campaigns. Because I had to earn money, so I did not have a lot of time in school.
