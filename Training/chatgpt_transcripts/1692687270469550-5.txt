Action and blockbuster films are more popular today. I personally do not enjoy watching them as much. They're good for feasting your eyes, but in the long run, the negative impact that I feel they have on people is that they lower their attention spans and they do not have patience to watch other movies which have a slow build-up and try to have some kind of ambiguity in them.
