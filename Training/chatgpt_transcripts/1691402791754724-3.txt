I think it's a good idea to live together several generations, because we can learn from the oldest ones about the history, the history of the country, and etc. And from the younger about their challenge, about to help them to challenge difficulties in life, and to try to be better ones. We can educate them in every part of their life, to try to give them a lot of information about the future, about education, work, and etc.
