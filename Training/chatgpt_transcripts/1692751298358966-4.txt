I definitely firmly believe that foreign language should be taught in elementary school. Children's brains are like worms for knowledge and I think this curiosity should be filled with the correct kind of information. Being bilingual or multilingual is common almost everywhere now and I think learning foreign languages in elementary school will not only help increase the person's educational knowledge be a good point in their CV but rather be a creative exercise for their mind. Children are amazing creatures with wonderful minds and I think their minds should be filled with knowledge and information such as language which really works the brain. And as I've read from many researches and studies, the first 10 to 15 years of a children's life are known as a learning stage for knowledge. Especially languages. During that time, children can easily learn any language without having to put in extra effort. However, after 15, that becomes really difficult. Thus, I think elementary school students should definitely learn foreign languages in high school.
