Speaking of writer, well, I barely read books, so I don't think I have one, but so far I think I know someone who is very famous. I believe it's the author of the Harry Potter, and I believe I forgot her name already. And how did I learn from them? Well, I haven't gone through the book yet, but the thing is that it was published like decades ago, and it still is famous up till now. And I believe it gives the readers a lot of mixture of feelings, some sort of vibes that the reader could get from reading the books, such as Harry Potter and stuff. And I believe Harry Potter is one of the best published books of her, I think, because up till now it's still very famous, and a lot of kids, not just kids, but also adults are also reading her books. And it was obviously popular in this era as well.
