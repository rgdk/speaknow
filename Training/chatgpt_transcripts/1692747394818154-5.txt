I would like to talk about the reading. For me, sometimes I... Actually, the reading is good for the people and also for me, but sometimes I don't have time to take the book or take the carrier, the book, on the bed or anything. So I just read in the phone, because in the phone we have the Google to research something that we want to read. Sometimes when I get the book, I get it in the library at my university or school to get some books like history, like history about English books. Sometimes we have like novels books or anything. For me, in my country, I think that half of the people enjoy reading the book too. Because nowadays when I stay in the bus station, I see a lot of people carry the book without using the phone.
