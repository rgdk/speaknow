I live in Carmel since I was born. I live here with the parents and then I get married and now I live with my husband here. I never thought I could move to another city. I love my city and I think to be close to the family and friends. My work is also here in the city so I don't see any good reason to move. Maybe in the future if the job will be in a different city I don't have another choice. If it will be far away or something like this I don't have a choice and I will move somewhere else.
