I think in Taiwan the internet maybe is not expensive because we have Wi-Fi in anywhere so if you have phone you can use like department store or MRT station will have free Wi-Fi. Not every home have internet. Some poor people will not buy internet and they probably didn't have phone. I think I'm happy with my internet I can do many things in the internet such as talk to my friend in the phone or playing video
