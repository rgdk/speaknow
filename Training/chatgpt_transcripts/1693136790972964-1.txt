I have a wife, her name is Chavatzelet. Now she is not working. She ends the academy school. And I have two daughters. One is a sapir, now he is ending the school. And she is before the army. And the second daughter is Koran. Now she is learning in the school. She is in class 9. That's it. Sapir is now working in a restaurant before the army. My wife, Chavatzelet, now is looking for a job. And Koran will start school in a few days.
