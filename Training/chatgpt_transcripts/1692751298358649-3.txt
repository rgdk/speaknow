To be very honest, I don't spend much of the day outside or outdoors. I go to college, half of my day goes in college, but then I come back home so I don't know if it counts or not. If I'm outdoor, I hang out with my friends, I have some good food, I enjoy mountains. I love mountains. I'm a mountain person, I can say that.
