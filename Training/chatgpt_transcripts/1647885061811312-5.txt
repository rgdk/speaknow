Yeah, I prefer to be remembered for my great wisdom and there are several reasons for this. First, people will remember smart people that have changed the world, people that contributed to the knowledge in general, and if you are kind with people, it's good, it's a positive feature to have, but it will affect just a few people. And when you have great wisdom, you can have a larger effect. It might affect families and communities and maybe countries, and I prefer to have a larger effect in the world.
