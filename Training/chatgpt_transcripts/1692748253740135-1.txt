Well, so basically I don't really like painting and drawing, but I like taking photographs. If I talk about the photograph, basically taking photographs is one of my habit, I normally do it during the weekend because it would fill my memory with precious memories that I have done with people in the previous time. Moreover, it is very convenient for me to take pictures or photographs since nowadays we are using technology stuff and so that we can take photos wherever we want and whenever we can keep it easily. If you're talking about drawing and painting, I think it's very difficult, we need to learn it, we need to spend a lot of time to be a good drawer and painter. I don't think I'm good at drawing and painting and I feel like it's quite boring to draw and paint, moreover, it's hard to keep those kind of stuff and we need to buy different kind of stuff so we need to spend more time than just to take pictures. Basically nowadays I keep my pictures and photos in my phone and my laptop or the drive. Nowadays we have this special package from the website like Google Drive or something which we have tons of space to keep the photos so it will be easier for me to keep the photo there and also it is safer than anything else. We can keep it for a very long time, we can share it to whoever we want and we can look it back if we have free time or want to revise our memory.
