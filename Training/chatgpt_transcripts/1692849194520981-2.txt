Well, I believe the answer will depend on the relationship you're going to get in your workplace. So there are some benefits you can gain from having a quality relationship with your colleagues in the workplace. For example, you can have a sense of harmony, and you can have a sense of oneness by co-working and having friendship with your close colleagues in your workplace. And also you can know how to communicate with others who have different kinds of personalities, characteristics other than yourself. But there are certainly drawbacks too. For instance, if you encounter bumping into someone who don't fit with your personality, for example, if someone is too introvert and reluctant to communicate with others actively, then she might feel very stressful and sometimes be freaked out in the middle of the conversations with other colleagues. So yeah, there are the drawbacks I can come up with right now. And I have built a great relationship with my supervisor when I was working in my former workplace. She has been doing her own work independently, and she did not interrupt my project also. She respects me, treats me in a very respectful way, and I admire her characteristics in that way because sometimes I can see many supervisors and bosses try to engage in mentees' projects and take the results as their own results. So I think my relationship was great with others.
