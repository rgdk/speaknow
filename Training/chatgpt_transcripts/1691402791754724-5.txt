If my government will try to focus on a cultural institute instead of a natural park, it will have to stay because of the acclimatization problems. Because of the air condition in a cultural institution, people will stay there instead of in the park. But on the other hand, a natural park is very important for people to stay out in nature and not stay only in air-conditioned buildings. So it depends.
