I think the parents can have their kids' passwords, but the parents can be always in the social media or of their kids, because it's going to be awkward for the child. I think the parents limit the amount of time, because the parents want the best from the kids and the parents don't want bad things for the kids, so they give a limit of time to spend in the computer or smartphone, like one hour or one hour and a half and bad things.
