I would say this type of art is actually a bit popular in my country. Because whenever I go somewhere in Phuket or in Phuket, I have seen a lot of street art and graffiti on the walls. Sometimes on up and down buildings. I personally think graffiti makes street art more unique. This is from my opinion only. I would think that the elderly would think that it is beautiful. Because it is some kind of messiness. The art is mixed up together. I have no idea why people choose this form of expression to me. For me, art is something that people can express from their feelings, like the bottom of their heart. What they are thinking and what they cannot express to other people. So they pick up art instead.
