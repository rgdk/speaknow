A good colleague is one who supports and encourages me and the whole team, everyone to do better and is positive and he keeps the morale high of the team. And people who I would not prefer to work with are people who are self-obsessed and do not care about, I mean they should care a little about the people around them, their colleagues and if one is asking for help, they should provide it or at least guide the person.
