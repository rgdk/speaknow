I really want to go back to Sinai to the Hushot on the water to have a vacation in Sinai. It's something different because you have the most feeling of freedom. The cellular is not working, you're on the beach somewhere, a deserted place. You have the sand, you have the ocean with coral reefs. You are like living the life in slow motion. Nothing happened, everything is relaxed. People are talking, joking. If you want to have company you can. If you want to be quiet and talk to nobody, you can do that as well. I want to do it because it's good for me, it's relaxed. I can come back to work more relaxed. It's the perfect vacation to do it. I think I will do it, me and my wife. I will take my wife to Sinai, to Rasa Satan, sit on the beach in the bay when the sun goes down. You see the sunset, drink some mojitos and enjoy life, relax. There's nothing to do. You don't need to take care of nobody. You don't need to care about nothing and just enjoy your time in Sinai.
