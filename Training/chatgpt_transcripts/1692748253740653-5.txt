Now I would like to talk about if it's okay to break rules if you disobey the rule. I think there are also a number of rules that they are fine to break. For example, like for girls to wear lipstick at school. When I was in high school or when I was young, students were not able to wear lipstick so I think it's fine to have some slightly makeup on. Whether you wear, I mean whether you wear, you know, like when I was young, students must wear sneakers to school. However, I think it's fine if we don't have to wear sneakers because we don't have money to buy those sneakers. We can just wear any other shoes like sandals or flip-flops. However, there are some rules that it's not okay to break. For example, like if you kill someone, if you do something that harm others, those kind of things are never okay to break. So, regarding the question whether I have a break a rule, of course, yes, I used to break a rule. I used to cheat in an exam and what the teacher do, they just they call my parents, they deduct my school.
