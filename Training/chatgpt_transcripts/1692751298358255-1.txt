I believe the people who spend their entire lives in one place are the middle class people who cannot afford to go to places for a better life. The people who move a number of times in search for a better life are the people who could afford such things, who could go from country to country to live a better life. They have enough money so they could afford going from one place to another in search of a better and a luxurious life. But people who could not afford such things, they spend their entire lives in one place.
