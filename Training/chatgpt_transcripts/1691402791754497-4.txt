Well it's a difficult question, I don't know what to say, I don't have any opinion but I think if there are different, I think this print source where, I don't know what to say, internet, now we can see everything and find everything we want. About children, children can, in some ages, can be allowed to watch news, I think it's important for them to know what's going on in the country or the world, they can understand some financial things or political things, they need to know that in some ages, not all the ages of course, it should be a limited age maybe.
