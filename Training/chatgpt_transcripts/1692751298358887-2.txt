Jobs become a very crucial part of a person's life. We work, we study for 14 years at school and then for 3-5 years at college just to gain a sustainable job for us to live our lives happily after. However, some jobs are just not satisfying to some people. Hence, the person who wants to get out there to explore their own choices and capabilities and opportunities outside of the job area, it makes them resign from their current job in order to gain that independence to seek out new opportunities outside. Yes, in my country, people often change their jobs for the very same reason. Some people just want to explore more opportunities, they want to give time to their passion, they want to do something that they love instead of cursing out their jobs, 9-5 jobs every single day. A company can make a person stay by recruiting them according to their passions and qualities and also providing the person enough peace and stability for their mental health just as they do for physical health. If a person is mentally happy and satisfied, he can sustain more physically than if the mental health is worsened. Hence, I believe if a company takes steps to even preserve a person's mental health side by side to his physical health, it can help make employees stay and give another try to the company.
