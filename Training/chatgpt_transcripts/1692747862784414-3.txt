If I were to talk about the place I like to go, I would say my mom's hometown. It is in Kampong Chan province. And I go there like on some special occasions or just like if my family were thinking of going there, we just go there. It's like unplanned. There we have like all the relatives are gathered and we have fun. We play, we eat together. It's really fun.
