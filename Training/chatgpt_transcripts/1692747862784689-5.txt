I personally think it is better to have many brothers and sisters because there are a lot of advantages of having brothers and sisters such as they can help you with your work, they can rely on each other and moreover, they won't be bored as they can play with each other on their free times and especially helping each other when doing some works Although being an only child also have some advantages such as some people want to be left alone, want to be in peace so it is the best to be an only child But for me, I would like to have a big family because I would rather coming home to see many big smiles on my family members rather than coming home and go to bed alone
