This is quite an interesting question. There are a lot of facets to address, but I guess I would say if I were the Minister of Education in the current country that I reside in, some of the changes that I would make would primarily be to expand the access of education for all children and to make quality education more affordable. There is high quality education available, but I find that that's limited to a certain segment of society and really you want all people in a society to have equal access to quality education as that improves the society overall and also make sure that you don't have any segments that are perpetually disenfranchised or unable to reach their full potential. I actually think that that would be my priority. I would like to lower school fees, I would like to lower the cost of books, I would like to lower the cost of uniforms. I think that people regardless of their financial background or their family standing should have access to the same high quality of education. While I think that it would be common sense or easy to make decisions such as that, you have to realize that there are differing opinions and varied moneyed interests that are always going to be involved in any system, whether that be healthcare, transportation or education. So you'll have to contend with different viewpoints and different interests. And I do think that that could make finding or achieving a resolution relatively difficult, even for some of the most common sense solutions. What makes me happy about the present situation in the country that I'm in is that each year there seems to be progress. We're not really where we need to be just yet, but each year you can see incrementally that we're getting closer to making education attainable for all people regardless of their income.
