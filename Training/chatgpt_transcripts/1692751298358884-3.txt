The ideal voting age is above 18 years old as a person becomes somewhat mature and is able to make his own decisions by this age. And before 18, you have not completed your schooling as well. So it doesn't make any sense to provide voting rights to a person who is still learning the basic education. And as this and as voting makes a lot, as voting holds a lot of power in choosing the next ministers of the country.
