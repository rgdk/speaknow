I think in the place I live, maybe there should be more parks and gardens or museums and theaters because it's more fun to the people to get some activities to do. For example, go to a park or maybe gardens or something to the museum or just simply want to see a movie in a theater. Why I chose this? Because I think it's more fun to the people and not only like have non-activity to do. Maybe this will help our people, for example, get jobs in these places, maybe in the museum or maybe in the theater. In other way, just to get to have some fun and get distracts of some problem of the people to go to these parks or gardens or theaters.
