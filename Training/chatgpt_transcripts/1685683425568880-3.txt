I'm not quite sure about the exact intent of this question. Is it a computer room in a house or is it a computer room in a community center? I imagine it is in a community center so if the computer room was to be built and we had to choose between an older person or a first grader I would probably say I would build it for the older people because they belong to a group of people who have had less access to computers or less exposure to computers and could benefit from having better access or having some computer lessons or having some help handy. This could help them develop their skills with using a computer, being able to access information and do everything else that is required.
