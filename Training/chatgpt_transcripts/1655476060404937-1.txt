No, I don't want to be on a reality show. The main reason why is because I really want to, I really take care of my privacy. I don't want the people all around me, especially outside of my neighborhood or my city or at work, I don't want them to know about me anymore. And what I want to give or to show, I prefer to leave it like that and to make my friend on my way.
