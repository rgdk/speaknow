Okay, my favorite book is the biography of a Van Gogh artist. This is a biography about the life of Vincent Van Gogh. The life, the story talk about his entire life from since he was a teenage until he was really older. The story tell all about his adventures and things that happened in his life and how his brother supported him for making art. I really like the story because I feel like his brother was very helpful for him and it makes me very enthusiastic and I really admire his brother.
