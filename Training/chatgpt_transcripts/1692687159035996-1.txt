Okay, so this case presents us with two options that some people prefer to spend their entire lives in one place and some people prefer to explore more and maybe settle down in different places around the earth. So I personally believe that the second option is better because staying at one place, yes, you may be, you may feel comfortable with the place, you could feel settled, but at the same time, you never really explore the whole world, you never get to experience new things in your life. When you move to different places, when you move across the world, you learn a lot more about that place, which helps you develop as a person. And staying in one place, yes, it may be like, you know, being in your own comfort zone, but again, going outside your comfort zone should also be priority of people.
