In my city, the system is that everyone should put, if he likes to, should put the plastics and packages in different bins, and this material are collected and dumped somewhere. The drawbacks is that it depends on the people, if they are willing to do this, and if they are not separating their garbage, it is not done. What might encourage people to recycle more? Maybe telling them that their dumped will not be collected if they will not recycle.
