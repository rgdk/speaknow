Last summer I was in my house all the time. I was learning about songs on the guitar and I liked it. I enjoyed it very good because it was very nice and it was great. It's one of my hobbies to play instruments. The reason is because I was very bored. I didn't know what I'm going to do and I wanted to learn songs and play someday in school with my friends. I don't know. But I like it and I enjoy it very good, very nice.
