Yes, I do believe that government have the right to actually force people to do things for safety because the government care about our safety. So that's why they could implement any measures to force us to do that. Maybe let us talk about safety on the road. So in Cambodia, people are forced to strictly abide by the rule. For example, they have to wear helmet all of the time regardless whether they are using motorbikes or bikes. They have to wear helmet in case that they do not wear it, they will receive punishment, for example, maybe fine of 10 or 20 dollars if they are found to not wear the helmet. So actually the rule is good. It's kind of, the people kind of feel forceful, but again, this is just for our own safety. So regardless of that, I think they have the right to do so.
