There are two sides to this. People who really want to pursue higher education, they should be allowed to go to school after 15, but people who want to pursue other fields in life which don't really need a lot of higher education can leave school after reaching the age of 15. The advantages of leaving school early, well, one of the advantages of leaving school early is that children can explore different areas of life, they get to know how life works, which makes it easier for them as an adult in order to live in the society and work. One disadvantage of leaving school early is the fact that education, as it stopped in between, it kind of makes it difficult for people to take decisions because they're not really sure of what's right and what's wrong. It mostly depends on the person and how they really want to face life.
