yes I study in Manorachana International University it's a very beautiful place and a very fun-loving place where we can enjoy and many many activities we cover it's a very comfortable and a place where there is no unsafety for girls and women I don't think that there is any need for making this place much better because it is already very much a wonderful and beautiful place
