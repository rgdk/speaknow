So here, we need to make sure that even if two people get into a relationship in an office, there should be a certain protocols that each one of them follow. Not only the those two people involved in it, but also all the people involved in the office need to follow the protocols. This creates a balanced environment in the office and between colleagues. So, yes, limitations should be placed but on not only to the two people involved, but to the entire office so that there will be a balanced environment.
