So the job that I want to learn is singing because I really love to sing and I hear a lot of music, both classical and western. And because the reason why I want to learn singing is because I want to keep it as a hobby. And also singing helps a lot. It's amazing and all the good and bad things about it. There is nothing bad thing about learning about songs and music and the good thing is that if you sing in a really well mannered and if you are good at singing then you can take it as a hobby, you can pursue it as a hobby. And why do people choose this job? Because if you have a good voice and if you want to learn how to sing then of course it is the one for you.
