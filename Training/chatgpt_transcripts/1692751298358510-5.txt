I think it's really important to study foreign languages as you know if you are going to a foreign country or the world The world is really big and to you know the masked differences or you know bridge the gap between the differences of two people living in two different countries with two different languages it You know it makes the gap between them, you know disappear and it makes it easy to communicate There are many benefits of studying in studying foreign languages you can settle in that foreign country You can communicate with different people you are opening yourself to you know widen horizons Not just being existing in your just own country and being satisfied by it But you know actually existing the world the whole world that's out there. I think the most important foreign language to learn is Spanish French and Chinese, but it's like really Mandarin sorry Mandarin is really difficult, but I think people should learn these three languages
