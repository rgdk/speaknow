It's a very interesting question. I think basically yes, because not necessarily the publisher shares the same opinion with the publisher, but maybe other people in the world or in the same country that the book is going to be published will have the same opinion. So I think you should reveal people and culture to a variety of opinions, so I believe so. I believe people should publish other opinions than what they are thinking about the same topics or issues, in a way to be objective, not to criticize, and let the readers take the decision at the end of the day. So I think the publisher should publish other opinions than the publisher itself, to write it in an objective way and to let the readers decide at the end of the day.
