Okay, this is one of my favorite topics because I love libraries. I love reading books I love the I love that I can go to a good library and just switch off and actually Like listen to my thoughts and learn a lot of new stuff that I didn't know before so the future of libraries in the digital era if I'm being honest, it's not looking good because there's a lot of Things that are coming up you can get a Kindle which is basically you can get any books online So there is like definitely no purpose for a library to be there That's what people think and a libraries don't get much business because of this which is why they closed down Changing roles of academic libraries in the digital age. I love the library in my college I always go there the changing roles is now they have also Adapted a lot of changes like they have brought When you enter you have to scan your ID and then there's All the books are kept in a digital format. So it's easier to find these books So I think those things are good because the digital hand-in-hand with actual physical libraries. I think they can both go hand in hand the internet can't replace obviously the The interaction because the librarians and the people in libraries they help they help with what you're like in order to If you tell them what you want, they'll help you to go to certain sections where you can actually find it and The library or some ways that the library can remain relevant is I think that they should adapt certain Digital approaches to like I said Scanning books and then keeping them in a digital format so that it's easier to find them and then also for Students to be able to find the books digitally Yeah, thank you
