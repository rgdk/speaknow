I think it's better for the kid and the child to study many subjects in the school because when you're conversing with others, you need to talk about other topics too. You're not like, nobody's just going to be in touch with one topic and always talking about it. And it also brings more diversity to our conversation, I would say. Let's say that kids are only studying what they want to study, then I think the knowledge of the kid is not going to be extensive and it's quite hard to get. And it's quite hard to get a job if you know just a lot of things. If you don't have a really, really extensive knowledge. I don't know, that's what I think. And yeah, that's my opinion.
