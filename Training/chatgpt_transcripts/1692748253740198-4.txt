Our education is, depending on the topic of education, we have the public education or state run or government education and the private education. The state's education at school, at public schools is actually free. Students just enroll and they can go for free from the primary school up to the university actually. Currently, in order to adapt to, because the state school cannot serve the needs of the parents, there are more private schools competing each other and challenging for the high quality of education. And now there are a lot of private schools opening up, especially in the cities, and now it's setting up to spread out at the outskirts and the other areas as well in the provinces. To me, I prefer more, if I had to choose, I have to choose more private schools because there are much better standards than the state ones. The state ones, usually the teacher's quality is limited and we got limited facilities. Private school has much better facilities in terms of state of the art materials used in the classrooms and the school campus. The extracurricular activities are also much better compared to the ones in the state schools. Although the tuition fee is higher in comparison to, I mean the tuition fee of the private schools is higher than in comparison to the one in a public school, but it provides the students with more opportunity to get quality education through various extracurricular activities as well as the in-class activities with the well-rounded experienced teachers, there are more activities and more care. For example, if a student is absent, the school, the parents will get a call or the contact from the school informing their student absence, their children absence. Oh well, I went to, when I was young I went to a state school and later I moved to a private school which I could see the big difference between the two schools.
