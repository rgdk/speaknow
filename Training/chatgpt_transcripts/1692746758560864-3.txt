My favorite season is winter. I like it because when I get out I feel like I feel like cool that when I get out and have a lot of wind, cloud come to affect me about my body. About the winter season that I like it because at this season I can fly the kite on the sky. I can fly it with my friend or with my family. This season is very cool to make me feel good and fresh when I go to the farm or to do something outside my home. And I always do it every year and at this season.
