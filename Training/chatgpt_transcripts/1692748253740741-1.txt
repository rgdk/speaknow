So I would like to introduce my friend Bora. So actually he is tall with short curly hair. He's a bit slim but recently he's been training in the gym so he looks more fit now. Actually we share a lot of things in common. So sometimes we love hanging out, having drinks in the pubs. Of course we love playing football. So every weekend we love kicking the ball near the suburb across my home. We love spending much time in the football pitch. And of course I pretty like him because we really appreciate each other. And on top of that I really love his personality alongside with his kindness and understanding.
