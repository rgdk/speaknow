I think that this is an excellent question. It would be quite difficult for social media companies to actually verify that everything is true. I think that truth today has become a bit of a slippery slope term. It would be quite challenging for a company to have to take it upon themselves to define whether or not a piece of information is true. So whether or not I agree with this statement, I think the implementation of it would be far more challenging.
