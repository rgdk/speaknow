Yeah, it has been noticed in recent times that universities have increased their offering of online courses. There are many advantages to this. Firstly, it offers students and interested learners a chance to obtain a certificate in learning from these courses. They can avail them from universities that offer these courses to them. And there are courses that are suited to online learning. I would say maybe learning how to use Microsoft Excel or Word in an advanced manner could be something, could be a course that could be offered online. It has, and also one more course, what we say is coding. I think you can learn coding quite well if you do it online. You don't really need an office environment to learn coding. And there are disadvantages as well to online courses because it's not really available to everyone, is it, because there could be countries that are developing and maybe people just don't have the facilities to avail these online courses. They may still prefer the old way of learning these courses in an offline environment. And yes, another advantage of these online courses is it can be made available to all. So there is no real discrimination as to who can take these courses.
