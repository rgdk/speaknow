The place where I live does have a clean water but not a clean air and especially the road is very sketchy and not good at all. As for my opinion, I think people can do many things to keep their environment clean such as instead of using their own vehicle, they can cut it off and actually using the public transportation instead. Help with the trash, for the trash they can divide it into three kinds of trash, the wet plastics and also the dry one. I actually try to help the environment by helping sorting out the trash, getting it into any charity work that have connection with the environment and I also cut down using my own transportation and use the public transportation instead.
