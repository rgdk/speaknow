Well, I would say theatres because where I live, well, around there have parks, gardens and also museums. No, but I'm not interested in museums so I don't think they should have one. And, yeah, because I don't like it all. About theatre, I'm kind of intrigued by theatres because I watch videos of people playing in the theatre. And I think it's quite, well, it's not interesting but I think it's classic and it's beautiful. Why did I choose this? I just said it, I just mentioned it so I'm not going to repeat it again. How would it help people? Well, I didn't think of that. How would it help people? I think it would help people to, I don't know, to probably let people feel the beauty of the theatres. And just probably let people have more leisure time spending on the theatre instead of in the films.
