I think there should be restrictions for publishing information in social media. The first reason of that is we can control fake news that can damage not just communities and individuals, but also companies and families and a lot larger groups of people. And we should find a solution for this and provide people just the right information that is trusted and they will get benefit of reading this information. I think it's a matter, we should not provide any information that could offend people because people are the users of social media, a platform, and we should provide them the best service that we can offer.
