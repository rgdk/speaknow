Well, first question is do I like to go into museum and art gallery? For my own opinion, I never go there before. Because in my country have a few museum but I never go there because it's not my vibe. I don't like museum or art gallery. And I will go there someday because I want to know in museum what we have, you know. And when I go to museum, I prefer with my friend because I can talk or share with them. And the last question is are there many museum or art gallery in your country? There are no art gallery in my country. And yeah, we have a few museum in Phnom Penh. So, yes.
