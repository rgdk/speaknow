Well, I think the school is wrong. I think it's very important to the funding in physical education too. It's very valuable in life and it's very dramatically a thing that you should know in your life how to use your body correctly more than use technology. You need to learn about live your life healthier and that's why you need to use sports classes for teaching those things. I think the potential outcomes for this decision is more people not doing sports and therefore they won't be healthier in their lives and it's very bad for society in my opinion.
