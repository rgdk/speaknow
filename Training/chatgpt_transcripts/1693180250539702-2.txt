I think as a conscious person have stress or worries in different things, maybe his life or one thing in his personality. Why do you choose to be conscious? Because I think it depends on your personality. Do you think you made the right choice? Yes, all the time I think, but also it's not all the time I prefer to do it, but in usual time be kind and be unstressed. Because it depends on the events I have heard or I have seen.
