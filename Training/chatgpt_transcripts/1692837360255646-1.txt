One of the most immediate reactions to the problem would be disappointment. I would be kind of disappointed that the reservation that I made hadn't been made. I would like to solve this problem by checking if there are any free reservations available for that given time period. If they're not available, I would just go to a different restaurant. And I would expect the restaurant to sort things out, help with reservations, like a new reservation for the family reunion. And if possible, I would like to have a refund for whatever was booked for the family reunion.
