People shouldn't be required to do a year of community service high school because some people have plans and community service won't be exactly in the spreadsheet of what they want to do. The advantages of this can be like a better society for people but only if they're motivated to do it. Usually when people are given extra work they don't like to do it. They do it hastily and badly so it would be worse than not having them do it at all.
