I would like to talk about work and old age. People should stop working at the age of 55. It is a bad idea for adult people to work because they face a lot of health issues and when they are young they can concentrate more towards work and they can put a lot of efforts but when they are in the elder phase of their life when they are getting old their capability decreases. No, I don't think that I will keep working when I'm old because I will like to enjoy my time after getting old being with my family because after working from since your adulthood till you reach your old age it is better that you spend now quality time with your friends and family because you have been working since a long time so now it's the time when you can dedicate yourself towards your hobbies towards your interest and also you can live the way you want to live you can do your favorite things you can go on a world tour explore the world and give time to your friends and family also do household things
