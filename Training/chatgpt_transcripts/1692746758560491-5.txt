I think people nowadays, they like to watch romantic films. Maybe romantic films are more popular nowadays and I like to watch it. And the films also can give you positive and negative effects on the people because they can teach people how to be a good person. And the film also can give an advice to them, to all directions, to all people who are watching the films. And the effect is they can teach people how to walk in a bad way or something.
