I would like to talk about fines. You can get fines for not following rules. It is fair to get fine for something when you have not followed a rule, when you have broken something, when you have broken a rule. You should get a fine because it is an effective solution for you to resolve your problems and also not to do the same mistake again. Like if you break a traffic rule, you will have to pay a fine to the traffic police. It will help you to not do the same mistake again.
