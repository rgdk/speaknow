We don't have a recycling system for recycling in our city, but as you can see it's really obvious because the city of Koln is like, as you enter the city you can see the street without a bunch of trash, so it's like obvious to me. I think that people could be interested in recollecting the trash of the city by movements that make people say like, hey come on, if you do this you can make money. I know it's something strange to say that it's only to make money, but it means that people could be interested in this type of help, like helping the city to make a better city, you know.
