CCTVs present all around us and they help us uncover mysteries and crimes that once was not possible for us or the police itself. CCTV has been such a great aid to the police and to the crime department. However I do believe there should be a limit to where CCTVs are placed. Public places are 100% okay to have CCTV cameras. However I think in private places such as inside a restaurant or a private lounge or inside public and private bathrooms, this is definitely a place where cameras should not be placed because once these footages get out of hand, this can definitely be misused. Apart from that, I do not believe that cameras violate anybody's privacy provided that they are in the correct person's hands and not leaked out of the government's office.
