The development of the civilization has been seen in the rapid growth and this is actually because of the discoveries or some sort of like different events happening from time to time. For example, the invention and also the widespread of the social media actually allowed people to communicate with each other through online without having to meet in person. It would also make it easier in terms of studying as well as working because when you study, again, they will just do the video call in order to complete the project or assignment. And for the work, again, instead of having a meeting in person, they will just host a meeting online where everyone can meet from anywhere that the internet connection is available.
