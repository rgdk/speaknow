Alright, so I'm going to talk about my favorite singer. My favorite singer is Taylor Swift. She is as American as I know. I like her music for the fact that it is original. She writes her own music, which is inspired by her own experience. What I like most about her music is that it is a reflection of reality, mostly. And it's very blackly and realistic.
