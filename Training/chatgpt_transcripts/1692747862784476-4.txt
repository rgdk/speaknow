My favorite classmate. I got many friends at school and I got to know many people at school. But for my favorite, it's two of my friends. They kind of be, you can say, we are best friends. Because we got to know each other for 12 years, around 12 years. So we got to know each other much and our parents also know each other. So it's kind of easy way and we got to know each other a lot. That's the reason why I like them. And of course, being best friends, we should have the same or similar attitude with each other. The same as us, we got the same attitude. So it's kind of be a good thing in friendship. We show the same interest. We got the same thing that we thought. We got the same goal. So it's really good. And if we got an argument in our friendship, we just got to talk. We don't have to feel guilty with each other. If we feel bad about what we did with each other, we just got to talk in a group and find solution and tell why we don't agree with that, why we don't like that. There are many things that I have done with them. We have hang out together. We have enjoyed food. We go on vacations together. And we really spend almost all time of day at school. So we got many time together more than family. I spent around 4 or 5 hours with them. Even though we're not studying together or we're studying different classes, we still have the weekend together. We spend all the time on the group chat to have communication with each other. So it's really good memory between me and my friends.
