For some the classes are not that important and which is why I think it should be an option to attend classes or not because if people should be should not be forced on doing something which they don't like or appreciate so when we have that option it also gives the universities an opportunity to provide quality learning since they have those students who are genuinely interested and not who are just forcibly seated into the classrooms.
