I would like to talk about my son, Itay. He's the youngest of my three kids. I think I like it. It's important to me because we are the same in a lot of aspects. We behave the same, we have the same humor. He's a very smiley kid, likes to smile. He's thin and long, he's high for his age, he's six years old. And we have a lot of games that me and him play all the time in the pool. We invented a new game called Kadu Karish, we like to play it in the summer in the pool. He likes to do a lot of things, he likes Pokemon, he likes playing the Nintendo Switch, the Playstation 2. He likes to build houses in the living room from pillows. Now he's going to go to the first grade, he's going to be a first grader with his brother that is older than him in four years.
