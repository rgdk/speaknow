The most difficult thing about my studies, I would say it's exams. And I find it difficult because I have to review and memorize lessons to take the test and in order to get good grades. And I think to make it easier, we should like review your lessons every day after you get back from school. And so, like, it's a bit by a bit then on the test day, you won't take too much time in reviewing your lessons. And also, you won't be having a hard time trying to memorize everything because you've already done it a bit by a bit.
