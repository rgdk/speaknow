I consider studying foreign languages really important. I believe that nowadays people should learn at least one foreign language, because as we go forward as a species, we need the projects which different countries start together, will require all forms of communication, and different languages are a must for efficient and convenient, to communicate conveniently and efficiently with each other. So the main benefit, in my opinion, for studying foreign languages lies in the fact that it opens you, that knowing a foreign language opens you a lot of new opportunities, opens a lot of new doors which you can walk through. As for the most important foreign language to learn, I consider English to be one of the most important languages, as it is the most widespread and the easiest one to learn among all of the languages in the world.
