My favorite subject at school was English literature. I liked it because I like reading and you know reading poetry to understand about the about nature and to understand the words and the thoughts of the poets is really mesmerized me and my Literature is something that I am also pursuing at my higher studies It's not very difficult, but it's very very interesting and people should study that I would recommend someone to study that because it It also teaches us about many It teaches us about English literature is a person who studies literature can know about feelings, emotions and culture as well.
