Well, it's a hard question since I am a car guy, I own a car, also I have a motorcycle, so it's hard for me to imagine that I wouldn't have my own transportation, a car or some other motorbike, etc. But I believe that I should be thinking logical, so I think that I would rather have no car, because the public transportation is more important, also I am living not far away from the town center, from the city center, so it would be more easy for me to live without a car than without a public transportation. Also, there is less pollution, so it's better if all people would rather use a public transport instead of their own cars.
