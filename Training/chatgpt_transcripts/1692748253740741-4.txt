flashback to my time in high school, I always did my homework regularly assigned by my teachers. From my perspective, I do believe that homework is still potentially useful because it gives you a wide range of opportunity to revise your lessons, to recall the understanding of the lesson, and of course, it's gonna be an outstanding platform for the teachers to catch up with their lessons and let students work at home with their parents. In my country, I've seen many teachers have given their kids plenty of homework as it is a traditional way and also the conservative way of learning and teaching, so that's what I've witnessed so far.
