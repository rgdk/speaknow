For most people, having good friends is important. Yes, it is for most people true because people cannot usually live among themselves. They have to have another person beside them. We as humans are all dependent on another human being. A good friend, according to me, is somebody who I can trust on and who I can go to any time of the day for help. And then somebody who wouldn't judge me for my insecurities or flaws. Yes. In my opinion, I am a good friend because as of now, I have not betrayed anybody. I have not judged anybody for their insecurities and flaws. And people do tell me that I'm a good friend, so I think I am a good friend. Having one person by your side is more than enough because that friend could be more valuable than the 10 other friends you have. Maybe one or two friends is also OK.
