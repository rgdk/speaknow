There are actually many different jobs I don't appreciate, but on the top of them all stands the retail sales worker. So it's a job which I never want to do, and I think the worst part of it is that usually people are quite disingenuous with the product they are selling, which they usually are required by the companies they work for to push onto other people, despite sometimes people clear disinterest in the product they are selling. I think that people choose those jobs, people choose that kind of job usually because it pays well, and with a good amount of sales per month you can get quite a lot of money.
