International media is very important to every country. Maybe first of all, let us talk about the advantages first. So, international media allows people to see what is happening outside their own country. Local media is good, but international media could just open people's eyes to the outside world, could expose them to what is happening in terms of political, in terms of social, in terms of technology use. Like, see what the world is like and this could help people to be open-minded to accept the new changes. But it also could have disadvantages because somehow we are exposed to something that is not very useful or something that is harmful to our society. Maybe somehow we adopt the wrong idea because maybe different countries have different situations. So, somehow what we see from the other country could not be applicable to what we could do in our own country. To me, I follow a lot of media from the other country, especially the country with democracy, for example, like South Korea, the United States, because my country is quite communist and I want to learn about democracy and freedom from the other countries.
