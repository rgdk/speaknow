The streets in our town and city are much better than I think 10 years back. Now there is I think some awareness among the people and everything starts from home and I think that the cleanliness of not throwing anything on the roads, pollution and any kind of pollution, water pollution, air pollution or industrial pollution have been maybe decreased due to awareness.
