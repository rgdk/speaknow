I'm talking about the differences between living in a house or an apartment. In a house it's much more comfortable than living in an apartment because we get a homelier vibe from the houses. In apartments we share a lot of neighbours which can be a disturbance to each and everybody in the house. And right now I live in a house so I think I would prefer a house because I've also stayed in apartments before which I didn't like because of the noises, the disturbance and many other factors. So therefore I would prefer to live in a house.
