Parents shouldn't monitor their children's academic progress because they have the ability to choose their progress by themselves. They can share their ideas, but not too much. My parents don't have any tool. They have never monitored my progress because I have always done it by myself. Sometimes it really affects students when some parents don't monitor their children's academic progress.
