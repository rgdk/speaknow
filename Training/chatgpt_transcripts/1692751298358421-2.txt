I do not like jobs which require someone to stay at their home. For example, work from home jobs, I do not like it because it's not difficult but it's boring. Because I am not able to connect with more people. I am just confined in my home and I cannot have exposure. But some people do like this job because work from home job. Some people do like because it is more convenient. It can save time and everybody has their own needs and everybody has their own way of... Like everybody is busy in some way or the other. So work from home may be convenient for some other people. But for me, I do not like it because I want some exposure. And I want to meet my colleagues and to know about the world more. And to stay in my home and do my job, I cannot do it.
