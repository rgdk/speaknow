I remember when I went to Siem Reap with my family members and I had never been there. So I drove a car and I hardly found the place to go to. I mean I hardly found the right place to go. So for example, if I want to go to Angkor Wat temple, I don't know where to go. So mostly I ask my wife to use Google Map to find the way to any places that we want to go to. Because there are a lot of temples to visit, so we look at the Google Map to find the place. And it allows us to get to the direction that we want to. Normally I went to Angkor Wat temple and then we go to have lunch and move on to Pha Khoan temple and other temples. But because we cannot find easily, so we don't usually go to many temples. Mostly we go to two, Angkor Wat temple and Pha Khoan temple. And walking in the Angkor Wat temple, it's easy to get lost because it's so big. And the architecture and let's say the structure inside the temple is so complicated. If you walk alone, you might get lost. I mean I already experienced that. Normally when I go, I walk in groups so that we will not get lost. If anyone gets lost, it's hard to find each other. It's hard to find him or her because the temple is so big. Thank you so much.
