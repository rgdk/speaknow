Well, most of the time, I usually get fined for, um... I'd say disrespecting traffic rules. Because, uh... Yeah, uh... Do you think it's fair to get fined for something like this? Yep, I do think it's fair to get a fine for something like this. Because, uh... Laws are meant to, um... Let's say, punish those who disobey the rules. Otherwise, it might lead to, uh... Social chaos without rules. And, um... Do you think fines are an effective solution? Yep, I do believe that fines are an effective solution. Because it makes people scared to lose, um... I mean, money. Which, most of the time, I mean, um... Might appear to be very important to most individuals. And, uh... If they are offered to lose something they love, then, um... They might be afraid to, uh... What? What? So, um... Nevermind.
