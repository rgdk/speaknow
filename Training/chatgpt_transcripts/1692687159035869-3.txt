Media in general is very important. So according to international media, obviously every individual should know what's happening to the earth, not just in the country they are. So I think it's very good. And me as a student, I am in India right now, but I would want to know what's happening in the United States or in the UK, because I would want to pursue my higher studies there. So I would want to know what are the things that are happening, what are the economic developments that are happening in other countries. So I think international media is very important. So those also come under the advantages of international media is that as a student, I'll know how these countries are doing. And disadvantage of international media is that it does like, you know, when you hear about all the problems that are happening in certain countries, you obviously you don't want to go there or like also there's also misinformation in the international media. They don't tell the whole truth. So I think those are some of the disadvantages. Do I follow media from other countries? I do. I do listen to the media from the US and the UK, because those are some countries that I'm trying to pursue my further my higher education for. So I would love to know what's happening there in a general point, in a general, general standpoint.
