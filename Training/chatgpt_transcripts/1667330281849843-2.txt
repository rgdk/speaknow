This is an excellent question. I think I would rather have more time. Thank God I don't feel in a difficult situation in terms of financial needs. But I do feel a stress of time. Time constraint is definitely one of the challenges I am dealing with on a day-to-day basis. So more time would definitely be something I would be appreciative of and feel like it would in a very generous way transform my day-to-day life.
