I think the biggest problem for kids today is the bullying because there are many people that is mean to other people that affect that people physically and emotionally. And I think it can be resolved by, if you are having that problem, you talk to someone you know and don't stay quiet because it can become worse and that can be the biggest problem for kids today.
