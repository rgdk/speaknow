In the last summer, our family took the cruise to Greece. And it was very hard for us because we can't go down through two days. It was very difficult to be in the closed place without the ability to go to the ground, always on the sea. And when we get to Greece, we were allowed only for several hours to go down. It was very difficult for us.
