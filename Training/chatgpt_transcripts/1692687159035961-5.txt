So, I do not agree with cars being banned from city centres. That would create a lot of chaos among a lot of people, as if there is emergencies to be travelled to and being on time on certain events, this could create a lot of chaos. This would be the reason why I wouldn't recommend or agree with cars being banned from city centres. It has its own negative consequences, as it creates a lot of traffic and it does waste a lot of time, but since each thing comes with its own consequences, negative and positive consequences, I would not agree with cars being banned.
