My first answer is no because for primary school assessment and evaluation are not that important for certain subjects. Primary school students are meant to develop their personality through creativity. Because at the young age the brain starts to develop. So they have to instead of focusing on the assessment and evaluation they should be more active and more creative. Yes but at some subject there should be assessment and evaluation for example and consider subject max. For that the assessment needs to be done. It helps us to identify and figure out how far students have learnt and which students need more help than other students. This should take place via communication but subjects like maths should be done through papers only.
