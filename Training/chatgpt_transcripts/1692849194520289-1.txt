I think city is better because I love some techniques and some state-of-art machines. And I like a vehicle like a bus, subway, which allows me to drive anywhere without a driver's license. So I think city is easy to live. And benefit of the place of the city is... There are a lot of benefits and plenty of benefits. And as I told you, I can reach a lot of infrastructure such as hospital, subway, metro, buses, and train. It allows me to go anywhere without a driver's license or some boring tasks. And I like shopping. So that could be a main reason to choose city rather than countryside. I like shopping so much. And I like Glomat. That is kind of shopping. The worst thing about the place I choose is definitely air pollution and noise. These days, a lot of air pollution makes people's health worse, including asthma and flu. A lot of things. The pollution and noise make people annoying and tired. So that is the worst thing about living in the city.
