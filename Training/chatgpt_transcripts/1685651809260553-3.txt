Well, in my opinion, the parents should be punished if a kid or if a child is committing a crime because as for me, the parents have a lot of responsibility on educating their child to not commit any crime. And also the environment that parents give the kid could cause that the kid is going to commit a crime. So I think at some point, the parent has some responsibility on this. And also, oh, but another point is that I don't think they should be punished severely. Like the punishment should go on the kid mainly instead of the parent because the kid is the one who committed the crime. But well, that's my opinion. Doesn't matter what type of crime is committed. Well, I think it does because if it were a murder, then it's a really big deal. And I think, well, yeah, and let me think. Okay, I think it does matter because if you are just stealing, I think you should only punish the kid because it's not a big deal. And that's something that everybody, like everyone, could do because of self-inertia or because they are envious about others. So it doesn't have, oh, I don't, yeah, that's my opinion. And if you were a murderer, then it's a really big deal. I think the reason that could cause a kid to commit a murder is probably the family.
