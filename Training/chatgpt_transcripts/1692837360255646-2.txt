I actually do think it is better for someone to get work experience before going on to higher education. People will be able to understand the loopholes that might be present in that category that they choose. They might be able to figure out how things work, how to work with other people around them, how to work as a team, and how to get things done. One of the drawbacks that you might have by working before pursuing higher education would be the fact that we have a gap in studying and that might cause problems in catching up or going back to studying. People who want to pursue an MBA usually work for around two years before pursuing MBA. That helps them figure out the problems that might be present and how they can fix it.
