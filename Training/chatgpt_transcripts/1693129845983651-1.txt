Recently, the Israeli situation regarding politics and government and the Supreme Court is very interesting since it has a dramatic influence to change the democracy and the life of millions of people in Israel. I think it is very interesting, again, since it can affect our life dramatically. The situation with the government is very complicated since most of the people who vote to the Likud did not know about the law, the effect on the law and the democracy. Now the government starts to progress laws that are not favorable with people, with public, because it possesses a dictatorial environment and people did not know it when they voted to the Likud. So now we are kind of stuck with a government for four years that does not represent what people want to see in the street. There is no, they are not handling the situation of the economic and the security in Israel, which is the most important two aspects, and they are more focused in law and government since the primary ministry, Benjamin Netanyahu, is under attack.
