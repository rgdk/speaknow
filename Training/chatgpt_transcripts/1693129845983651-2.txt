Oh, so I don't really like birthdays, so I can speak of the most favorable birthday I did to my spouse, not myself. She told me that the person who will take her to see lights in the sky will be the one that she will marry with. So we took a trip to Eilat, and I ordered a special tourism that took us at night to the desert, and it came with special equipment like meteorology, and we take a very good sight into the lights, and he explained to us about the stars. It was amazing because everything was dark surrounding us, and it was very romantic and very interesting. The tourism was explained about the stars. We drank wine, and the funny thing is after that, we were actually married, and today we have a daughter together, and we are very happy, so I think it was a very important birthday. Like, you know, it's funny, but it's not because I did it. She was married to me, but I think it's a good story for the children. So it was very romantic, very beautiful, very interesting, and of course become the love of our life story.
