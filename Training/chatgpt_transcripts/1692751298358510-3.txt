I think it's a very good idea for my city council to create a computer club for elderly people because I think elderly people lack knowledge and like every generation should, you know, improve themselves and learn new things about the ongoing generation. And it would definitely help elderly people to use computer for, you know, maybe contacting relatives or people who live far, far away from them. And I would definitely would like to work as an instructor in such a club because I love elderly people and they're really naive and they're really sweet and I think that if we have the expertise and knowledge so we should always help them.
