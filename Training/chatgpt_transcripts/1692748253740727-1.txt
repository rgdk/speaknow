Well, the type of films I like is called She is a Man. It was, um, it was showed in the movie for, I think it was about 16 years ago. Um, it's American film and yeah, I love the characters, the actor and actress. They both, um, and they both, they're both excellent actors and the reason that I like them because this movie is a type of comedian movie that made me laugh a lot and I can say I watched it for many, many times. It's about maybe five times and I often watch the film when I have free time. Yeah, and when, um, I'm on holiday and my friend, I also recommend to my friend to watch this film also because she's a film lover as I am, as I do, and and then I love to talk about that film with her because we all know the storyline of the film. Thank you.
