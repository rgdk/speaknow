Homework is necessary for me for the reason that in school I actually did learn a lot and I also catch up a lot but once I get into my house without doing any practice or homework I would forget all of it in just one day. I think that the teacher should assign me more homework so that I could not forget what I learned today. I actually don't spend a lot on my homework because my teacher doesn't assign us a lot of homework.
