I would like to talk about one of the most well-paid jobs that I've known so far, which is being a doctor. So being a doctor is quite interesting and also difficult at the same time, but of course it is a well-paid job. So the average salary in my country ranges from $20,000 to $50,000 per year. It is really a bonus one if you can pursue this degree and enjoy this pathway of career. If I happen to accept this job, I would say I would be capable of doing it, because due to my perseverance and hard work, I could say I would perform this job well. And of course, on top of the reason is that I would love to help other people.
