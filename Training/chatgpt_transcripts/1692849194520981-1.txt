So nowadays I can see that there's an emerging blurring in the differences between the roles of men and women in one family. I think there should not be set a particular stereotypes toward the genders. So I think that women can be excelled at her experts rather than her husbands. And she can make more money than her partner. So it's not important to consider whether he or she is a woman or a man. It's more crucial to consider the individual's perspectives or individual's competencies toward their work and for their role in the family. And I can see different kinds of changes are occurring in my country too. So women do not hesitate or reluctant to go outside to do their works. And sometimes we can see on the television or on the Instagram or YouTube channels women who are highly appreciated in her company. So I think that the differences of the two genders are no longer suitable. I mean dividing these differences of gender is no longer suitable for in these eras. I believe I can be to role as a super woman or a super mother in my family in the future. Yeah, I'm anticipating to my future works.
