Now I am living in Kandahar province which is near to Phnom Penh city which is the capital city of Cambodia. There are many good things about Kandahar province. It's kind of modern buildings, long roads, wide roads, clean government. It can be easy and convenient transport. There are many transport around each everyday. It's kind of modern city so it's full of schools, supermarkets and hospitals. So it's kind of easy for people to live in it. It's also good to find a work or find occasions for their life. There are also good and bad things in one way. For the bad thing, it's kind of overcrowded. For example, in the weekend people used to go for vacations or going to take rest around the road or go to the riverside. So it's kind of overcrowded. Sometimes it's kind of traffic jam at night because people are used to drunk. And they are just drunk while driving so it causes traffic accidents easily. For the bad things in my country, it's the capital city of Cambodia, it's Phnom Penh. Which is the popular place and full of people, full of workshops, full of companies. So it's kind of easier and convenient to find a job. And also it's the best place for tourism. There are many kinds of places to visit. People used to go to Phnom Penh when they stay in the countryside. And so Phnom Penh is the best place to find a work and to go for a rest. There are many places to visit. So it's kind of a good place in the country.
