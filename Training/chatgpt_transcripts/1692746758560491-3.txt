In the place where we live in, where I live, it's very clear, clean air and water because we keep our eyes on the environment. Because the environment is very important to all the people and we can keep the environment clean. Such as we decrease the amount of plastic and try to reuse all the plastic bags after we do. After we use it and we call, we try to ride the bus and decrease the riding of the car, motorbikes. That's all. Yeah. And I have tried to help the environment. Like I tried to use the water bottle and don't use the plastic bag and... Yes, that's all.
