To talk about friendship, friendship is something that I greatly value. The kind of friendship that I want from a person, the characteristics that I see in a good friendship are a friend should guide another friend, support him with everything he does, help him with things that he can and bring peace to his life. So by the, by as we say, to guide a friend means a friend should always help another friend to walk in the right path, help him with everything that he, help him with the difficulties he faces. Support a friend, supporting a friend is also very necessary. I would always want my friend to support me with the right things obviously, stand behind me with any decision I make in life, guiding, supporting strength that I have behind me every time is very necessary for me. The next thing is helping, helping a friend is also very important. It's a characteristic that I highly value. A friend in need is a friend indeed. You don't always need a friend when you are happy or when you are, you want to share something that is big, but you always need a friend to be by your side when you are in a difficult time. I do have friends with these characteristics and I am greatly happy that I do have them in my life and I thank God for it.
