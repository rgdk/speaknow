In my opinion, I don't think it's better for white people to get more experience before going on to higher education because when you continue going to a higher level of education, you don't need to work in the real society. The benefits of doing this is that you can focus much more on the education solely, so that you have more time to read and explore in depth and also analyze in a more detailed way. But at the same time, there can be some disadvantages because probably you've got to spend more time on doing all the assignments and other related research and probably you don't have time to do it all. I believe focusing on just studying would be the greatest choice because there's more room and more time to complete what one has been assigned to.
