I live in Melbourne, Australia. The culture here is very diverse. There are a lot of cultural activities to celebrate different communities. For example, we celebrate the Ramadan here, which is a holy month of the year. And also there are a bunch of other activities that people in Melbourne celebrate because it is such a diverse city.
