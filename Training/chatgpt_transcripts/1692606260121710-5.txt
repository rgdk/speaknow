Yes, I have my friend who is far away from my place. She lives in Palwal. I have been in her connection for over 10 years. I think more than that. And we share a very good connection. Every year we have a birthday celebration and we enjoy our company a lot. Yes, it's very important for someone to be in connection with the friends who are away. It makes the bond more stronger than it is now. And friendship is very important. Yes, meeting them once a month sometimes is very important.
