I would prefer to take a backpack around the world. So the advantage of this is I would get to experience and look into the world and also experience the beauty of the world. So here the advantage will also be added on that I wouldn't have to pay for all the expenses. So the transportation cost would be low. Also the disadvantages of this choice would be there will not be a certain amount of time that I can give into my career as per say. So for a year, taking a vacation for a year would also mean taking a setback from my career. So yes it has its own disadvantages as well as advantages.
