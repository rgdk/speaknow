No, in my opinion, I do not think that there is any sort of moral duty for a professional athlete to be an upstanding citizen or a role model for anyone. While I do think that it would be ideal for a professional athlete to inspire people to have better standards or to behave like better citizens, that's not really part of their job. Asking a professional athlete to do always be law-abiding, upstanding, and some sort of bastion of civilization isn't really commensurate with the job that they've been hired to do, which is physical exertion. So an athlete shouldn't have that role any more than, say, a teacher should be responsible for following traffic laws, precisely. It's just it's not what they are hired to do. While they can inspire, while they can be role models, while they can advocate for good causes, that is great, but that is not part of their job description, so I do not find that it would be part of their obligation.
