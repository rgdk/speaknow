I would prefer to be remembered for being with great kindness because I think that the wisdom is a thing that is always changing, it's always a subjective thing that people from different backgrounds are treating it with different ways. I think that kindness is our aim, our target in the world, and since God is very kind, so we must be kind as him. So this is a great question.
