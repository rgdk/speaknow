The area I live in is in a small village in a town of the city. And the village is not really that big, but it's really peaceful. And I do like where I'm living right now, because it's not quiet and also not too loud. And I am not the type of person who loves to live in big city or busy places, so I really like where I'm living. It's really peaceful and calm for me.
