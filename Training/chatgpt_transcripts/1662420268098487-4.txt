Well, I think different work office is not usual in the future. Maybe we can define our births in different things because the manipulation of the genetic is very, very dangerous but it's a benefit for the people and maybe we can understand that I think maybe we need to make the human nature really, I'm really worried about that because we don't know the future has pollution, has contamination, has a lot of things but I don't know if only in the nature or maybe it's more in the mind of the people and I maybe I think in the future if we don't change now in the future maybe we don't have nothing, we don't have anything or the people disappear to the earth but I think we can change and we can go to other planets or we can go to other contexts or we can approve different political laws that care people and pollution, reduce the pollution and reduce the, I don't know, the mental health benefits will be more interesting.
