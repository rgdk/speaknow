In my opinion, the characteristic of a good colleague is first of all, one of the most important characteristics for anyone in a workplace, which is to basically have their own boundaries and understand and respect the boundaries of other people. A team player who understands that gossiping in workplaces, crossing each other's boundaries is wrong and one who strives to be disciplined while at the same time being understanding of the other person is the kind of a person that I would like to work with. The entirely opposite are the people that I would not like to work with, people who do not take up initiatives, do not understand each other's boundaries, do not communicate well and therefore lead to gossips are the kind of people that would make a workplace inherently toxic.
