Okay, for me, Maths was the toughest subject in school because I just don't know, I couldn't get a hang of it. It was easy, but it was hard. I just couldn't understand. I had so many tuitions. My school teachers were there, but still, I was very dumb in Maths. And yes, that subject is important, I guess, for those who pursue Science or Commerce, but no, it is, like regular calculations, it is required in daily life, which is fine. And yeah, many people helped me a lot with that subject of Maths, like my friends, my teachers, my tuition teachers, everyone, even my dad. But still, I hate it. I still hate it.
