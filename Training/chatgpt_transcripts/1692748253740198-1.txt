So, I'm currently living in Takhmel town which is about only 10km from the center of Phnom Penh city in Cambodia. There are a lot of interesting things around and inside the town. And most importantly, the more interesting ones for me are the shops. So, there are different kinds of shops that sell various things like clothes, shoes, and we also have other things like even the brand new clothes. We mean about fashions, we got like accessories, other things like foods and merchandise. So, there are various things there. What I like about my neighborhood is the traffic. The reason why I sold my house to come to live in Takhmel is because I hated the traffic in my previous area that I got stuck almost every day especially during rush hours. But now, coming to live in a new place, I really enjoy the light traffic. Even in rush hours, I can actually reach home in less than 20 minutes. And what I really like about my neighborhood is the people.
