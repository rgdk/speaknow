Teenagers should choose their parents advice when choosing a career because their parents have gone through that phase and they know what can be the best for you. Because they have gone through the phase and they have experience and they know by this experience you can do this, by this experience you can do this. Yes I am often affected by career choice because as the world is developing we can go with career choosing as the world's preference and yes parents advice is also good for this because they are experienced ones. People choose same profession as their parents that may be good because their parents are doing good to that they will also do good, there is nothing harm in doing same profession as their parents. Many do the same, many do the same job and etc.
