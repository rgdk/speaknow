If I were given a chance to see a family member from the past, I would choose my grandmother. Because she had taken care of me very much when I was young. She had everything she had with me. Whenever I had issues or problems with my parents, she would be the first one that I went to. There would be a lot of things that I would say to her. But especially I would tell her that I've always loved her so much and I've always missed her. And I was blessed to have her as my grandmother.
