I think the economy here is the biggest invention for all the people that live in Panama because we have 2 dollars and too many countries don't have it in Latin America and they have like a very big inflation in their countries. We can't mention Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and other countries from here. So we can't, yeah, we have a better economy than the other places here so the things normally are too cheap or like aren't too expensive in other countries that are here in Latin America.
