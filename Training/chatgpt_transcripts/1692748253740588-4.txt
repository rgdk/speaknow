Well, whether the exams are an effective way to test a student's knowledge, depending on the factual situation as well, I'd say for some cases, it is really significant to use exams to test the student's ability to check their understanding, whether they have learned something or not. However, for some cases, it is really difficult to measure their understanding because some of them appear to be in a very unique condition where you cannot just use a question based on the lesson to test their understanding. Probably, it's going to be better to make it more practical by probably using some sort of tools that can measure their brain or something. When it comes to choosing the betterment of the exam, I think it depends as well. For some, I think it's going to be the written exam. Some might prefer the oral ones, but I prefer the oral ones because it takes less time to think and it is based on actual time to convey the message to the examiners. And what's the best way to prepare for the exam? Out of time.
