Well, yeah, I am a person of more fashionable, I like fashion a lot because I believe that being well-dressed is give us a kind of self-confidence, also self-respect and like people also get admiration from people because when you dress well, people will think that you are well-organized, you know, people who are like dressing, lazy in dressing, just even dressing you are lazy already so let alone doing a job, so they don't give you, because people will judge you that you are such a disorganized person. The last time I bought a new clothes was just yesterday, I went to Aon Mall, like the biggest mall in the city, it is one of the most expensive ones and the standard one, which is popular and also well-known for both locals and foreign people. I bought this pair of Pedro shoes plus a wallet, still the same because I love branded products but Pedro is the kind of the product that is also the branded one but in a limited, cost not too high like Louis Vuitton or Gucci or Versace. To me it was kind of not so expensive nor cheap just because it is a kind of average people with rich income could afford it but however people with low income could not afford it but I like the quality, especially the quality of the leather that it stays longer and it doesn't dies out easily and the colors doesn't also easily fade, which is one of the other thing is that I got the membership card so I got special discount especially on my, if I buy it on the regular days I got like 10% discount but if I make a purchase on my birthday I got 20% discount so it is a good deal for me.
