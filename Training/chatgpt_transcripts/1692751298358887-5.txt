I have broken a rule or a couple of rules previously during my school. One of my friends fainted during the break due to a heat stroke. We were never allowed to rush. We were never allowed to get out of the school or get before the school ends. We were never allowed to exit the premises. However, the gate was open and there were no teachers or supervisors around. So I had to run out of the school and get some medicines and a water bottle for her, a cold water bottle because none of us had any cold waters for her to get her consciousness back. Also, our pharmacy in the school was closed that day for some unknown reason.
