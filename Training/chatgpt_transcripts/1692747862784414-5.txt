Yes, I do enjoy learning English because it's the second... it's the world's second language and it helps me a lot. Understanding native speaker and also being able to speak to one is a really pleasant feeling and I need to study English because nowadays jobs require the employees to be able to talk more than one language and you can travel the world with English. I don't think English is not really that difficult for me. It's only difficult when it comes to new words and like when you don't understand it but it's really fun to learn English.
