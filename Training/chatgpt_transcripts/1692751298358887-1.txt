Of all the apps in my phone, I absolutely love my e-book reading app. It's called e-book reader. Basically, I read a lot of books, paperback or e-books, to keep my mind sharp and also to pass time. So that's definitely my favorite. I use it during commute whenever I am traveling to some place and I have a lot of free time in hand. I read books from there. It also sometimes has, in some books, it has the accommodation of listening to the words. Like an AI is speaking out the words, so it becomes like a podcast for me as well. I love it because I love reading books a lot and that helps me to save time through e-books. I don't have to carry a paperback each time I am outside. So my phone is just enough for me to have thousands of books inside of it at the same time.
