The main difference between public and private education in my country is Here the public education quality is lower than the private educational quality Though private education is expensive, but they dedicate a lot towards your child's future And the education there is far more better than that of a public institute or public educational college or school So according to me, I think that private education is better I will definitely send my children to private education system Yes, in my country private education is very popular
