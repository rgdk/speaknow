Absolutely no, I hate studying online. It was not effective the way that physical study or physical class can offer. I used to take online before and well, I didn't do well on those previous days. But I can say that the subjects that most students always or usually study online, it is English. Well, English is a language studying, so there are many things that people can keep everything in control. Well, I hope that online can be still popular like today. Because it is so convenient, people can stay at home or be in multitask while studying and listening to teacher. And there would be a little time that people associate with discussion and whole class discussion.
