Yes, the teacher that I never forget in my mind is... He is... He is a male and he is tall and has nice skin and... He is always friendly to other students. And yes, I like him so much because he... Always help me and also friendly to me too. Also to others. And while in class, when we have a problem or... Not sure about something that we are doing, we... Always ask him and he always help me or others too. The activity that I always do with him is... Do the homework. Or... Playing fun activity in class. Yes, of course.
