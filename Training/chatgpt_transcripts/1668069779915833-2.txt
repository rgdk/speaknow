So I would prefer to be most remembered for great kindness because I'm a more people person. I like to hear people's needs and I love to serve people and to make them feel better. And I feel and I believe that if you help to another person, it's much, much good that if you are more sophisticated or smarter. I believe in to do great things to another person. So yeah, I definitely go for great kindness.
