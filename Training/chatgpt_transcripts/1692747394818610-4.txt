So now I describe, I talk about homework. I usually have homework, I always have homework when I have class like Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And I think it's homework useful for us because it can make us review and self-learning at home. And do children in your country get a lot of homework? For my own opinion, you know, I think it depends on school. Some schools they give us a little bit and some schools they give us a lot, you know. So, depends on school.
