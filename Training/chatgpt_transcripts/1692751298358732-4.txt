Okay, so my favorite classmate is Ananya Gain. She's a very amazing girl. The reason why I love her the most is that because of her psychological way of speaking, way of describing things and understanding things. She's very short and very pretty looking. She's very studious. She's in my section. We both are doing English honours. And the reason why I like her so much is because, yes, the way she understands me, she understands how I think. She, if needed, she can be a very good therapist. And most of the times we discuss about our career, we talk about how things should be done, especially she does. She explains things in a very well mannered way and she tells me to do in this way so that I can get good marks. And not only in studies, she helps me in all way. I am very frank with her. She listens to me. She understands me. She tells me what to do and what not to do. So yeah, she's one of the best people I've met in college.
