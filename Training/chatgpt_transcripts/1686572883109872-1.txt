Okay, so the most interesting thing in the news right now for me is sports news, because now I love basketball. I do play basketball myself. And now it's the time when NBA, so National Basketball Association finals are going. And only two teams are left. So it's, it is the finals. And Denver Nuggets are playing against the Miami Heat. And now the Nuggets are up 3-1 in the series. And they are playing until some team wins four times. So the Nuggets need only one win. And Miami team will need three more wins in case if they would want to win the championship. But most likely the Denver Nuggets gonna be NBA champions 2023.
