The most useful class that I have ever taken is music class. I was really into singing but I wasn't much of a good singer back then. But taking a music class has helped me improve my vocals and become a good singer. I learnt Carnatic classical music and it is a beautiful genre of music and it not only offers vocal stability but also peace of mind.
