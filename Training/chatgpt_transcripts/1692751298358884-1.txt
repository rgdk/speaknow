My first most immediate reaction would be to ask the hostess whether there are any tables which are unoccupied and if there are any unoccupied tables then we would like to sit over there and I would expect if there aren't any free or unoccupied tables at the restaurant that an apology be issued from the restaurant to my email and that's about it.
