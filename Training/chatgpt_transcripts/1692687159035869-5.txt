Some people are intrigued by antiques and ancient monuments. So this is true. I have heard of a lot of people who love history. They are very interested in where they have come from, where we originated from, what has happened in the past that has made us what we are right now. So I think that people are intrigued by the past because of, now for example, the Taj Mahal. The fact that it's such a beauty, it's such an ancient monument but it's still so beautiful and people keep coming and looking at it because of the story behind it and what an important thing it was for one person to dedicate this ancient monument to as a gift to his wife. There's a story behind that and the fact that people want to know what it's about and it's also like being in touch with your past in order to make sure what your identity is right now and also in the future. The next question, do you need to put special effort into protecting ancient things? I agree because you need to respect your heritage because you need to be proud of where you came from. For example, I'm from India and India has a very rich heritage and there's a lot of temples, monuments, like I said the Taj Mahal and I think all of that needs to be protected because that just shows where we come from and the values that we have as Indians. So I think that it's very important. Special effort is obviously, I want to make sure that we reserve it, we conserve it and we make sure that in the future, we educate our future generations to also put an effort into conserving these monuments.
