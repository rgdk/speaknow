The universities I think are popular in my country are RUFA, ChemEd University, and I think they are popular because of the education quality. RUFA is for designing whether it's graphic or not graphic, and for ChemEd it's business, so if you want to study business, ChemEd I think is the best choice. No, I do not want to study in one of them because that's not what I want to do.
