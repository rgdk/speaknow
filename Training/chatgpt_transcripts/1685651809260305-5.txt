I want to learn persons, they learn the physical and mental characteristics of the person. And it's very interesting for me. I want to do that because it's really funny to see how much nervous, helpless, sad they can have. They can stay, they can be. And it's really, really comforting for me hearing people watching it, seeing it, and trying to learn how it feels, how it's doing. And I will do it, trying to learn it from the internet, learning about it, trying to see another experience from the recording, the dream, a little dream that I have.
