More and more people these days take online classes maybe the reason is because They find it much easier than the face-to-face classes and then there are people who are socially Anxious so for those people it's better to take an online classes But for people who like to study among their friends It is better for them to take a face-to-face classes. Both have their own reasons That why it should be good or why it should be bad and then According to me, I think yes, there will be more number of people studying online in the future because The generation is changing the technology is increasing as well According to me in my opinion Face-to-face education is more effective as It is More challenging and more refreshing Yeah
