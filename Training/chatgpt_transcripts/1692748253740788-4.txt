Monitoring children's academic progress is very important. To me, I believe they should, that they should, I think they must monitor their students, their children's academic progress. Because they send, let's say, parents send their kids to the good schools, let's just say like ACE, AIS, BLT, Westline, or some even send their kids to even more better school, like Southbridge, Northbridge, Footprint, ISPP. The reason is because they want their kids to have a better education, to have a good education for their future. So if they want it, they should look at their children's academic progress and they need to help them at home. Look at their activities at home. Do they do their homework? Do they spare some time to review the lesson? Do they spare some time to read a book? Or they just play a game all the time? So the parents must play an important role to monitor their children's academic progress. Maybe they can have a good contact with the teachers or academic officer at the school so that they can know the progress of their kids. To me, parents play a very important role in helping the kids to reach their academic goals.
