I think celebrities like actors or professional athletes should have two different standards like behavior because people and especially children that celebrate these actors or these athletes see these celebrities and do what they do and if their behavior will be in the high standards and their behavior is good to the community and to their surroundings it's good for our community and good for the world. In other side if their behavior is not good in the low level it's bad to our community because of this I think they should to have the different standards and behaviors.
