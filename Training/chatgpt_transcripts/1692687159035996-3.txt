We live in a digitalized modern world currently and electronic communication is at the tip of everyone's tongue right now. They have access to mobile phones, laptops and other gadgets that helps them to communicate across the world. So there are many benefits of this. Firstly, it's a way of communication to someone who is from another country or another place. You don't have to use old methods like sending them letters. This is a much more feasible option where you can just send them an email or drop them a text or give them a call. The drawbacks of this I would say is, you know, a lot of people tend to misunderstand what is communicated to them, maybe because of a voice cut or network issues, they may not hear the message properly and then they could interpret it in the wrong manner. That is a drawback of electronic communication. But I would say it is very much required in this day and age because it has more benefits than drawbacks. Fewer benefits would be, again, I think everyone has it so this makes it a lot easier to put your point forward to the person you are communicating to.
