So the importance of involvement of audiences can be different by the kinds of performances you are taking into account or you are trying to consider. Maybe the musical performance can be highly affected by the existence of audience because they can dance and they can sometimes talk directly to the audiences and ask their opinions about the plot, about the protagonist in particular drama. But on the other hand, you can come up with the performance, musical performance, which plays very classical music. In a theater, you can make some noise in that kind of performance. So it's very different from each by each performances, I mean treats. So we have to consider what kinds of musical or theoretical performance are you looking for to see the importance of the existence of audience. So yeah, I think that's all I can say for now.
