Well, if you're talking about dream job, actually I have completed or accomplished my dream job as to be an English, the teacher of English. Basically, this job is one of my favorite jobs since I was a child, since I was influenced by my grandma. She's also, she was a teacher since she was in the middle of her age. The job, it's pretty good to me. I think I'm good at it since during a study at the university, I normally like to share things regarding to lessons, some difficulty regarding to our lessons from different subjects. Whenever I taught them, I felt like I was happy during that time because I'm happy to see people, they knowing something else that they have no idea what is it about and I think it is good. I like this job, as I mentioned, I like to see people happy when they know something new, when they misunderstand about something and I just explain them and they just realize that, oh, it is just like this easy or that's it. So, yeah, that is the reason I like to be a teacher. Moreover, I think knowledge, it's not easily passed on from one person to another. So, I think for the person who has like the ability, the innate ability in the way that transfer the knowledge from one person to another, it is the great way. So, I would find myself in that way. I think teaching is not a very hard job since we have the innate ability and moreover, we are ambitious in teaching. So, it won't be a difficult job unless you are not ready for doing it. So, it will be a very hard job.
