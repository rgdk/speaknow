The thing that is very difficult about me when I'm working, I think is when to deal with the customers. For example, I study at a bank, so I need to deal with the customers to solve the problem. I think that sometimes the customers come and they feel aggressive or they don't feel good with the service. So they just walk out and say something that works for them. But I think that for me that is okay because this is for work, we're going to have a lot of customers, it's not the same. For me, I think that I can make it easier when they feel aggressive. Just tell them about the reason why today the service is not good or anything is not good. You can tell them and they will solve the problem for them.
