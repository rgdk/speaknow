Okay, basically I do really like the spending time outdoor because you know just to spend like every day in your bedrooms or in your house it's pretty much stressed. So I decided to go outdoors and it helped me to refresh my mind, meeting other people, talking about this and that, sharing some experience, sharing some studies, activities, habits or news so that we can update ourselves, you know, we can become a person who is up to date because we have a good communication with people, learn something new from the outside also to refresh our feelings. Yeah, I think it's great. Basically when I go outside I normally have a meet up with my friends or colleagues but most of the time I would spend it with my friends and family since we don't really have time to go outdoors from day to day like five to six days in a week. We spend most of the time for working and something so we have only one day left during the week. So we decided to go out and having a good time, having a good time talking about this and that, sharing some experience, sharing about some habits. Yeah, that's it. And the outdoor places that I like to go the most is the beach because I can say that I really like the beach. Whenever I go to the beach I like to listen to the sound wave, the wave, the sounds of the wave. It refreshed me up also with a beautiful landscape that touched my feelings since I was a child. So yeah, I think the beach is one of my favorite places that I really like the most.
