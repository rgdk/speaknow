Absolutely, parents are responsible the way teenagers spend their free time because they have a duty to guide their children's well, that is obligations for parents. So in many cases, including studying or playing or eating anyway, parents must guide their children to behave well and just advise some good hobbies to make their child grow well. So useful things teenagers can do with their free time, I wanna just recommend social club to share their own thoughts rather than just computer gaming. I just want teenagers should grow up should encouraging their social ability and social intellectuals by joining social club. It will help their they can share and make debate on social issues. So I think teenagers should have a lot of free time because they need to think their own life rather than just studying or university. They have to think about their way to live their life and that could be in a lot of free time.
