20 years from now I think that AI will take a big part in our future. I think that artificial intelligence is a very important skill and it's a very important tool for the world. In 20 years from now we see it everywhere. It will replace a lot of workers, it will improve our life, we can use it for medical, for computers and we can do anything that takes us a lot of time to analyze data. I think about the workers, I think that new works will be available in the future after the AI will enter more to our life.
