I think homework is very necessary for students to just recognize they are understand the lesson or there is a way to knowing new information to this lesson. How many hours a week do I spend on homework? Now I'm in the period of the university so I don't have very homeworks just sheets or maybe tasks. Which of your school university subjects have the most work? Yes, the most homework in school not university.
