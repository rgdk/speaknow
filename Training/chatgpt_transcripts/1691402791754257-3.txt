The most important things that we can do to protect the environment are to give financial support for projects that are ongoing for environmental improvements such as the cleaning of the sea, such as renewable energy, such as handling all the plastic that we have in the world. We really need to give financial support for these projects since the lack of money is the most important thing for them to upgrade their opportunities, for collaboration, to invest in important things. This action is more important than others since the money is a big part of our world and we see in the past that if we spend money on things that happened, so this is again a thing that we must spend money for it to happen in the future.
