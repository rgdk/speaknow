I got many friends that stay away from me. But it's really important to stay in touch, whether we stay away from each other, we stay in other country or we stay in another city. But the best way to stay in touch is you can make a conversation through the social media or social network like chat or Instagram. It is the best way to stay in touch with the people that call us friends. People stay in touch by many ways. There are many ways to stay in touch with your friends, such as call or telegram each other to stay in touch. Before, people used to write an email. But right now, it's kind of easy. Technology is everywhere. So people use your smartphone to connect with each other, to connect with people that we love, or to connect with our loved people. So it's a good way to stay in touch with your friends, whether we stay away from each other.
