I prefer to stay in a hotel room. The things we need to consider while choosing a hotel to stay in is number one, if the locality is safe, number two, if the hotel provides good facilities and number three, we have to also check if the cost is within our budget. On my last vacation, I stayed in a beautiful resort in Bengaluru and the place was really good. It was outside the city in a sort of a suburban area and it was really peaceful. I stayed there for three days and those were the best three days of my life.
