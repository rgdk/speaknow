I think it's good for parents to have the password of their kids because for example in the internet, social media is sometimes a very dark place for kids and I think if the parents have the passwords they will check and they will control what their kids are doing or seeing in the internet or social media. I think that the parents should limit the amount of time of what kids spend on the computer or smartphone because it's not healthy and it's not good for a kid that they spend all day in the computer or smartphone. It's not healthy for their vision, their eyes or just simply their mental health and I think that it's better to control the time that your kids spend on the computer or smartphone and for example, I don't know, one or two hours a day.
