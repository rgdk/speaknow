The biggest global issue today is discrimination against women on the basis of sex. We are living in the 21st century, yet women are considered properties. What I recommend is we need to let go of the prejudice that is so deeply rooted in most of the socio-religious institutions. The Indian government has implemented a number of schemes in this regard and they are being used now and there is hope, a belief that one day we will achieve gender equity.
