Yes, art, music, dance, painting are as important as the education that we are learning. Since it's a hobby or a talent that we are producing, that is why it is something that's coming from within. So education, we are learning something whereas the art, the dance, the music, it's something that we feel interested in. So a learning and an interest, it should be in a balanced form. So if I enjoy dancing, I will be taking part in college events as well as I will be focusing on academics. This creates a healthy environment for me to be in my university and this initiates a growth within myself as well as surrounding me.
