The best thing about being a boss is it can work everything, or can earn a lot of money, or can use or tell the person that you want to do something. The bad thing about being a boss is sometimes it has a bigger problem on them. If we are not doing well with the work when they are doing someone. For me, I want to be a boss because it's easy to find the money, to have my family, and sometimes we do not try to do it a lot. And if we are a boss, we don't spend a lot of time to do the work or spend a lot of time to do something.
