When I was a child of six years, I literally disappeared from my mom's sight. And I walked into a park. There was a fear of touching. It was really quick. That was an amazing fear for me, but for my mom, she was crying. Literally, she was crying. She was really, really, really preoccupied about me. She didn't know where I was. That was a really bad thing for her. The result will be that after that, I need to walk with my mom and join her with the hand of my mom. My mom didn't leave my hand anymore. When I was 10 years old, she gave me her hand and I can go with her. That is a habit of her.
