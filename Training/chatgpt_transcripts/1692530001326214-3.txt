I consider charity organizations important because there are a lot of different problems which we as humankind face in different countries and different situations all around the world. Each of those organizations kind of handles some of the issues which we may have. I don't know any popular charities in my country to be honest and I have never supported in any monetary form any of the charities because I am not really self-sufficient right now unfortunately.
