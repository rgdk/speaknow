Achievement is important for me because it could be put up in my profile once I graduate or apply for work. I have this achievement where I placed number one in my debate on my previous school. I didn't expect to achieve this because it is my first time ever joining a debate competition. I was so shocked when I achieved this because I just didn't prepare for it or think that I would get it. This achievement affected my life because I realised that I actually have a potential and I also have a talent for this kind of things.
