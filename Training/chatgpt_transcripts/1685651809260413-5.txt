I think one of my dreams or I want to do in the future is to travel around the world. I think the reason is because I want to explore some cultures and new people and new languages. English for example in the United States. I think I can learn about the other countries. I can expand my mind. I think maybe when I finish school, maybe I will take three months to have a travel around the world and maybe could have my dream to travel around the world with new people and cultures. Maybe with the help of my mother, with the economic way. That's it.
