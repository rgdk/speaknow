I live in a very good neighborhood. We have everything, literally everything. Cinemas, supermarket, shopping center, 3-5 coffee shops and visitors who visit my neighborhood. They can go to cinemas and they can read some books, chat with friends in high quality cafes. Talking about the favorite place I want to go, I really want to go. My favorite place is beyond Mall Street. It is a high quality shopping center. I've been there many times with my brothers and my family. I have no idea the best place for my... what will be the next best place in the next video.
