Of course, people have, yeah, people start schools at an early age and finish school when they get around 22 years old, finish bachelor degree. So then they need to go to work to earn a living. And when they go to work, they will be so busy with their work and have less time with their life, let's say, have less time with their family and friends. So how can they balance between their personal life and work? They need to know how to balance their time. To me, I believe that after working, I can chat with my friends through social media so that I can keep in touch with them. So I will maintain all my friends, they will not go away from me, even though we are all so busy with our work, we still can keep in touch. Or sometimes, let's say, at the weekend, we might go cycling together or eating out together to build our relationship as a team building so that we are not so obsessed with our work. We also have some time to enjoy our life with friends, relatives, and family. So to me, I do believe that if I balance my personal life and work well, I will enjoy my life. I enjoy it. I believe so. Thank you so much.
