I think the most needed jobs in the future will be that of medical professionals. These jobs are popular even today and they will remain popular. Our world is polluted, our food is poisoned, so more and more people are falling sick. So, of course, we need medical professionals to keep us alive. And I don't want to do one of these jobs because I am a very clumsy person. And as a doctor, you will have somebody else's life in your hands. And I don't think I can deal with that stress. I'm too anxious. So, I don't want to be a medical professional, but I respect doctors, I respect nurses.
