The age at which people should stop walking depends on the load they can take and they should retire at it when they think they cannot walk easily. It is a good idea for elderly people to keep walking because their bones and muscles will still work if they are walking and if they are not walking they will sit at home and become lazy and their bones and muscles will drop and they will think that they can't walk anymore. I will keep walking when I am old because I know I can walk, I have the capabilities to walk and I will walk for myself because I don't want to be lazy and I can walk till the time I will walk. If I think I can't walk now again then I will retire.
