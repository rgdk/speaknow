Exams. Exams is something that all children fear about. Not only children, we can also say that even the college going students are also very scared about exams. So is exams a correct way to test knowledge? I do not think so. But maybe, ok. It also depends upon on how you conduct the exams. Conducting exams just for the sake of it, a lot of portions that needs to be covered will be covered in a short time span and then the students will just go by heart the same information and come answer the exam. Here in this case, it's not the student's knowledge that is tested, it is their memory. People, not all, not everybody has great memory and that is not what needs to be tested here. So according to me, I think whether be it oral or written, I would definitely prefer written exams. But what needs to be tested here is people's knowledge. So instead of rather giving, rather making them write the same exact thing, a lot of different concepts needs to be tested. Even in oral exams, people need to be given the skills to talk in front of the class, to give out their own opinions out loud and a lot of debate competitions need to be conducted where students can come in front openly and confidently talk about a lot of things. This way, they will make them a better person and not just by hearting things is going to take them up in life. These are the things that needs to be brought into their life too. The best way to prepare for an exam is by understanding the lectures that has been taught in class and then reading through all the information that has been provided to you, understanding each and every concept thoroughly and not just by hearting everything.
