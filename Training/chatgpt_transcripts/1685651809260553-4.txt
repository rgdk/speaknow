Well, in my city, in my case, I didn't saw any system for recycling. But, well, because I've seen a lot of trash thrown in the street and everything, so I didn't see any system for recycling in the city. But I think what might encourage people to recycle is just to give them money because people in the city sort of like money. Yeah, and another measure that could help is probably put a lot of trash cans on the street and also advertising the importance of recycling and everything. Well, at least from what I have seen, there's no any system for recycling in the city. So I think the basic thing is what the city could do in order to encourage people to recycle.
