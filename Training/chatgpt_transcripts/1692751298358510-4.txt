I think exams are actually an effective way to test a student's knowledge and without exams I don't think anyone would even come to school or come to college or any other educational institute and I think both are better, both exams written and also oral exams. Oral exams help us to you know like present oneself and written exams helps in our written capabilities our urge to think, write and assess you know what the knowledge we already have and best way to prepare for exams is definitely studying every day and firstly have like an interest in what you're actually reading and learning. So yeah if they have you know a keen interest in exams and they learn, learn or read every day then definitely we'll be really much you know ready to take on exams.
