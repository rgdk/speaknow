I can say it depends if talking about studying online. I like studying online when I don't have free time to go to school or to take the physical class because it saves my time from traveling far from my house and it saves gasoline, saves money and I don't need to get dressed really well or do makeup before I go outside. It's just focusing on repair the lesson or get ready for the class start or just try to finish homework for the teacher. Of course I don't need to get up early to prepare everything as I study in physical class and it helps me a lot when the weather is not good, for example when it's raining. I don't need to take the raincoat and a lot of things that are much easier for studying online. When I studied in university for my degree, almost all subjects because of COVID-19 the country was, the students were not allowed to go outside so we studied online. Yeah I think studying online will be popular in the future because it will help the students that live far from the city to study in the city.
