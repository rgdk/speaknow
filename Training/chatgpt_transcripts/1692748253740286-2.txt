The best thing about my work is that it is a very rewarding task. It's a very rewarding work to do. Since I'm working as a teacher of English, so every time that I see other people grow and develop, I feel so rewarding. Plus, English is one of the most important languages we learn in my country, Cambodia. Since now I have to be in a position in a job, a high-spread job, I mean that, one has to be good at English. So if there is something I would like to change, that I want to be more equipped with more knowledge in my skill.
