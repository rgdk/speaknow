I prefer to be the first person to explore a planet rather than being the inventor of a drug that cures the disease. I can think about two main reasons for doing that. The first reason is that I read a lot of science fiction novels in my childhood. I would be happy to be the first man to step on one planet. Furthermore, I think there are a lot of things that we can discover on a new planet. It's a great adventure that I would not miss in any case. Another thing is that I'm not in physics so I will not invent a drug that can cure a deadly disease. I leave it to other people that are more proficient than me in this aspect.
