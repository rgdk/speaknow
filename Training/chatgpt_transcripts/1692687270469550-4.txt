I've attended the seminar on existentialism and provided a deeper insight into why we are here and how or whether we are just products of random chaos. I like it because I'm interested in existential themes and finding more about the universe. I think it is useful to me because it helps make my convictions more stronger, provides a stronger foundation for my beliefs and makes me question more, which is a good thing.
