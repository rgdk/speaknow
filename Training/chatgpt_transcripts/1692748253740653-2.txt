Now I would like to talk about work and old age. In my opinion there shouldn't be a limitation between, there shouldn't be any like specific rules or specific age that people should retire. People should retire whenever they want to, whenever they see that their physical body could not cope up with the work anymore and when they think that their emotional well-being are not well. So I think that there is no good or bad whether elderly people should keep working. If they feel like they want to work, so let them work. If they think that working will be detrimental to their mental and physical health, then they shouldn't keep working. And in my opinion, I will keep continue working even if I am old. This is because I am not, this is because I am not used to
