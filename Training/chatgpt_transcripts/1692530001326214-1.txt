So my favorite TV show would be The Firefly. It's an old sci-fi series about a group of interesting and different characters coming together on a journey through space. I really like it mainly because it's a sci-fi series which I genuinely enjoy. And because of the cast of the aforementioned characters. The show is not really popular in my country because I don't think it has ever been translated to Russian. So I have only seen it in English and that's about it.
