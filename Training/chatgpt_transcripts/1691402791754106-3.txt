We just came from a trip, a family trip to the mountains of Czech Republic. It's called Spingelrov Melin. It's a place that in the winter you can ski, and in the summer you can do hiking in the mountains, you can do water sports in the river, you can do bike trips. We went there as a family, we took a hotel, a very nice hotel. We saw a lot of mountains, a lot of rivers and falls of water. We went to museums, we went to parks for the kids, amusement parks for the kids. We saw a lot of German people there. We did, what did we do? We went to the pool, we went for hiking, we did alpinistic rides. Yeah, it was a nice vacation, the kids loved it. Because they had a lot of attraction, on a trip you get what you want. It's a more relaxed situation, between the kids, between the family, everybody's having fun. And I think we're going to do it again. We enjoyed very much Prague and Spingelrov Melin, it's the place we stayed for a week, it was very nice.
