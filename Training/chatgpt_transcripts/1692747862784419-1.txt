I prefer a hotel room than AirBnB because from younger till now I have only visited a hotel room or stayed in a hotel room. The most important thing when choosing a place to stay is that looking for the best option, the best prices and also the cleanliness, the hygiene and the security of it. As I remember, my last vacation was in Kampot province which is located in Cambodia. The place was good for me and the price was a bit high but it is also acceptable since the place is actually a bit luxurious.
