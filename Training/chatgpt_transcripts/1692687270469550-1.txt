Staying in a high altitude region where the weather is generally colder, we buy mostly woolen clothes to protect us or shield us from the colder weather and prevent cold related diseases like hyperthermia and stuff like that. So you buy such clothes mostly from the local market and it's not necessarily important to follow fashion because you don't generally have to hop on the trend. It depends mostly on the person's subject to conditions, how he's feeling at that moment and how he feels, his comfort level.
