My best friend is named Pearl and he's handsome and he's smart and study and sometimes he hang out with me and play football with me, like playing games also, or hang out speaking at the market or mat. I like it because he's my best friend, he can tell me about his problems, sometimes I tell him about myself and he can keep it and not say anything.
