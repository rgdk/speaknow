The education they give to my country is free for the education. For me, I think that the private school and public school, I think that is good also. For me, I prefer the private school because sometimes they have good policies, good than the public school. One more thing, they have a lot of programs for the students. They have some projects, good projects for the students to do. The school that I want to study is ISPP, but I think that is expensive. But it's okay for the country, free for the education because there we have a good environment and we have a good teacher. For me, I think that the environment is the best because it can make the student feel good to study here.
