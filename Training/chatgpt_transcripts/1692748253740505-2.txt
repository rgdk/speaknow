I am a person that loves my job and one of the best things that I love about my job is I meet a lot of different type of students almost every day, every term, from a very young age to adult. And teaching is not only about teaching, I can also learn from them. For example, when I teach young children age 6 or 7, I learn many new tips and techniques in teaching them and how to manage the class, so on and so forth. And while I teach the adult or young people age around 12 to 16, I learn another type of techniques that I could use to teach them. And it's really best to meet those people, I mean the students, because I can learn from them, I can have fun with them whenever I am in the class, that's really good.
