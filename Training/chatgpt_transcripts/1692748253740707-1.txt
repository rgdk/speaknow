So I own one piece of clothes which is a pink floral dress. Well, I bought that like 3 months ago. It was because I had to perform on a singing competition. And well, it was only $5.00. I bought that from a thrift store. The reason I am obsessed with that is that it has a very good quality. I like the design. When I wore it, it made me look like a princess in a fairy tale.
