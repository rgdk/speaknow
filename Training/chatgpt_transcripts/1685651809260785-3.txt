I think that the kids should love to choose what they want to study, because, for example, some kids they want to be doctors, or kids want to be teachers, and there are subjects that are irrelevant for those jobs that they want to be, and maybe if they are not allowed to choose what they want to study, maybe they will be more distracted, or they will not pay attention, or they are not going to be patient of what they are doing. So if they are allowed to choose what they want to study, it's better for them, and better for everyone, because they will pay more attention, and will be more passionate in what they want to study, and while they are studying.
