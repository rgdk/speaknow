I went to the United States, more specifically, New Jersey and New York. I walked with my grandma and my aunt and parents, my mom, my sisters, and my cousins. That was very beautiful. I also saw a discovery that was amazing. It was really, really, really, really beautiful to see. It was very beautiful. It has a lot of light. This is brilliant.
