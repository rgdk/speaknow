Well, my dad is a delivery guy. He works as a delivery service. And in Cambodia, there are many pages that sell online. And, well, his work is kind of freelancing because he delivers some orders for an online shop, which is in a office building. And my mom, she is a housewife now, but 10 years ago she was in the military, but she retired now. And honestly, they don't like their occupation that much because their occupation is based a lot on physics. Then mentally, the mental and spiritual. And my mom stays at home, so I have no idea how many hours can be a good answer. But for my dad, he leaves the house at 5 in the morning and comes back at 7 p.m. every day.
