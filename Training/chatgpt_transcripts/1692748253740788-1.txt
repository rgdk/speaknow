Talking about friendship, what are the most correct, most interesting? Making friends, first of all, we need to take a look at their personality. If they are sociable or friendly with you and they are helpful, yeah, it can be your good friends. But if some friends like to ask you for money, borrow your money, or asking you to go for a walk, or spend a lot of money on gambling or drinking beers, it's not good. So it's a better idea to find good friends rather than just having a lot of friends who are always asking you to go out to the nightclub or drinking beers every time and like to spend a lot of money. So it's good to have good friends. Thank you so much.
