Yes, because it depends really, really bad on how they raise the kid. And how they live with him, with the kid. It matters if it's a she or a him. You're raising a kid, you know the pulse that you're going to have with it. You know that it's not an object, it's a human. He has feelings, he has thoughts. He has to think the way he can of the way you are raising it. And it doesn't matter what type of crime is committed. Like if he kills someone, you can see that raising the house is really good enough for them. So we should take a really strong hand to the parents. Because they are not raising their kids in a good way.
