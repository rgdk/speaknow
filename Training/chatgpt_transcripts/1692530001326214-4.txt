I think that homeschooling became really popular lately because of the convenience. It's extremely easy to keep your child around, but also to provide them with education, because of the internet, because of the online courses, applications like Zoom and other communication systems. The main advantage again would be the convenience of providing information for the internet to the children and generally the amount of information they can access through internet. The main disadvantage would be, I guess, the surroundings of the student. Personally, I don't think I would educate my child at home. I would prefer for them to receive their education in the proper facility, so to say.
