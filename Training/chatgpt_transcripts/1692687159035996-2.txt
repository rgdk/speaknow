Well it has never come to me where a task has been assigned to me and I haven't thought that it was ethical. So yes it has never happened to me but I think that the best way to handle it would be by firstly speaking to someone about it. So if it's at a workplace speaking to someone who is at human resources could be one way to handle it. You could tell them your problems and and why you think that it is unethical. So the first step would be to confront people about it and put your points forward stating why you think that is unethical and why it shouldn't be moved forward with.
