As a student for an all-girls high school, I am very pleased that I studied in an all-girls high school. I think girls and women benefit far more from it being a separate sex, separate gender classrooms. I think that in lower school years, it might be beneficial to be in a more co-ed classrooms, so that might be a consideration to take into account. Boys might feel differently about this, but from my personal opinion, I believe that women and girls should study separately.
