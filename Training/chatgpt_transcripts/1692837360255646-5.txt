Antiques and ancient monuments usually show the history of a certain place or country. Many people are really intrigued by these things as it reminds them of the horrible past and they might be feeling really sad about what really happened in the past. But I think we need to put special effort into protecting these ancient things as it shows how the country as a whole moved on and how they have developed and how they faced the issues that they faced in the past. It's really important to protect the heritage of the country no matter how hard it feels. And I do believe that protecting antiques and ancient monuments is as important as protecting the culture of a place.
