Some people are intrigued by antiques and ancient monuments because these ancient monuments tell us the history of a particular country and they help us to know a lot about the past lives of our country. And we need to put special efforts into protecting these ancient things because we gain a lot of knowledge of our past ancestors and of our past knowledge of our country which helps us in developing our country which was done in the past so that we cannot repeat the same mistakes again. So it helps us in a lot of ways.
