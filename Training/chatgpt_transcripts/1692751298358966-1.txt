I believe that judging others too quickly is wrong. First impressions are not inherently one's best impressions, as has been experienced by me. For example, a person that might be meeting new people in their workplace or educational institute might come off as off-putting or shy or not quite interesting due to their own dilemmas and thoughts, but once we get to know them, they're the most interesting person we have met. So it's all about perception and getting to know a person by giving them the time to explain themselves, not by judging them on the first impressions.
