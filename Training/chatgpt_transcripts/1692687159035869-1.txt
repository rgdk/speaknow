Okay, I believe that there are two options presented here. One is that a person stays in the same place. And then the other is that they go to different places for a better life. I believe that the second option is better. Because personally, I think that you cannot grow to your full potential when you are in one place. You need to explore you need to see different traditions and be around different people in order to truly know what you want to do in life. For let me give some instances. For example, I am a student who's been studying in a certain area, but then my like I'm doing my bachelor's. So if I would want to do my master's I want to I would want to go to another city or another country so that I can see how the education is there and accordingly decide what I want to do for my future. And I would also want to go to a place where I would have more employment opportunities. So if I would go abroad in my field now if I'm doing management, I would go to a field I would go to a place where I would have more exposure to businesses so that I would be able to give my level best and have a successful career.
