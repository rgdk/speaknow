I would like to talk about the differences between living in a household and living in an apartment. So according to me, living in a house is not more expensive than living in apartments. In my country, houses are more common than apartments. I live in a house. I would prefer to live in both. A house will give you a feeling of your own ownership. But if you live in an apartment, it will be definitely a bide one and of course you will get a lot of benefits with your apartment like there can be more safety security guards and also you have neighbors to interact with. But living in your own house, you will be alone without any neighbors, without any kind of community. Also in apartments, there are a lot of facilities which are not possible in house.
