My favorite classmate is my best friend Rhea. She is a very fun loving and a beautiful guy. She helps me in my any kind of doubts or clarities. I enjoy her team and often when I am in doubt, tensions, and despair, I often talk to her regarding my problems. We both share a very good connection which makes our bond very much special.
