I think we should try to narrow the gap between the have and the have not because this is to reduce the inequality in the society. Like if for example let's say we have a big gap between the rich and the poor and let's say the rich will just become richer and richer whereas the poor will become poorer and poorer. So the poor might see it as a very unfair society that they are currently living in. So of course in order to become transparent about that we should try to narrow the gap and then maybe the society could create employment especially for the unemployed or those who are poor like try to provide them with jobs instead of let them be unemployed. And the government needs to make sure that there is a very stable political society. Probably like there is no unrest in the country that they are living in. For example in Myanmar there is always a fight between the government and their citizens so it seems like it's not ideal. So yeah.
