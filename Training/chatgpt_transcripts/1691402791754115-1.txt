I use my cell phone a lot. I use it for emails and Facebook and Instagram and I want to be in contact with my friends. I have all my calendar in my cell phone. I have the birthdays of my children and I have notes and I make a list of the things that I have to do or not to do and before I'm going shopping I have also the list of the things that I have to buy. I have a lot of photos so I have after each trip I make an album of the photos that I do during my trip.
