Well, I like to play instruments, for example, I like to play the saxophone. I am learning about that instrument. I know how to play the guitar. I like those instruments to play. I use it in the week, all the time, especially the saxophone, because I am in the van of my school. I need to practice all the day. I usually use my cell phone to have tutorials or have something to learn. For example, in YouTube, you have learnings and lessons to practice with the instrument. It is very useful for me.
