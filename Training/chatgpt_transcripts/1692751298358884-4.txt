I think libraries won't go anywhere and they will still remain very relevant as the amount of knowledge a person can gain from the books in a library in a quiet environment and around people who are as motivated as you to learn about the world about certain things is you can only find in a library and in a digital era you can't expect peace you can't expect the people to be around you and you can't get their insights after going out of the library obviously so the libraries can continue to be relevant by installing computers maybe so that people can use these computers to learn from videos etc as in a peaceful environment and not only books
