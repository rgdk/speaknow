Okay then, if I have an ideal project, I would first try to get some funding from my family and turn to banks or some rich people that I know. And I will try to write some grants and ask some help with fundings. First I will build a team that will think with me how to proceed with the idea and try to purchase things or machines that will help me proceed and create my thoughts and dreams. That's it.
