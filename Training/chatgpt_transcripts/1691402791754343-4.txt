For many years, something that I have done for many years is to help people in different ways. It started in the school, school year, to help a student to understand the studies or the lessons or their homework and to learn to do their tests. And after that, in the army, I help soliders in my team to do their things and to exercise and to achieve to be perfect and professionals. And in the work, I like to help people to do their work professionally, and I like to work in team. And I will do that after and in the future.
