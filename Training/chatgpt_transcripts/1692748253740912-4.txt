Lately, the role of the teachers have changed a lot as a result of the technology. First of all, let us talk about how technology has helped the students. So in the past, most students relied a lot on the teacher, like in case that they have any questions, they would ask the teacher. But nowadays, with the advance of technology, for example, we have the internet where the students can get access to and do their own research. So somehow it could help lighten the burden of the teacher, like the students do not have to rely a lot on the teacher. And the teachers will also feel less pressure, for example, in terms of marking and doing assessment or giving assessment to students. In the past, they would have to do it manually, like marking the students' paper and stuff, but now maybe they can just assign a link of the exercise and maybe they can post it in a digital platform and let students complete it by themselves. And it just automatically marks by itself, so this could help the teacher to reduce their paperwork. But I also believe that there could be also the drawback of the technology, because we have robots and we believe that one day the robot will replace the teacher. So somehow the teacher could be in a dangerous position of losing their job in the future. But again, whether there is a robot or not, I think we still need teachers because they could understand the feelings and what the student needs, rather than a robot who simply does not have emotions to understand the people's needs.
