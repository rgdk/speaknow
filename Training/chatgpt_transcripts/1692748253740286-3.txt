One of my favorite seasons is rainy season because I'm living in the tropical area so there's only two seasons, such as rainy season and dry season. So the reason I like the rainy season is that it's cold, it's not too hot because I should know that the key people do not work practically in the very cold weather. So for me I work better when it is cold. It's not really cold actually, it's like it's not too hot because it's not winter so I don't know if I can say that it's cold or not. The things that I like to do in the rainy season is that I like to go to my hometown in order to enjoy myself because in the rainy season my town is surrounded by water so I can just go fishing with my family and friends and I can also enjoy myself to focus on my weekend. Thank you.
