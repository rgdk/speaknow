Some of the qualities that I think that are important in a good supervisor is that they should be interested in team building. They should make sure that every person in their team, he knows the strengths of each of them and make sure that they work in an environment where one complements the other. I also think that the boss should be patient with his subordinates and he should also give a platform for his subordinates to creatively pursue things. I also think that a boss should have good listening skills so that he can listen to all the problems of their subordinates and be able to help them grow. I chose all these qualities because I think that that is what I would want in a boss if I was ever working under a supervisor. Why have I ever had a boss that's like that? I have had mentors in my life which have been striving to make sure that I come out of my shell and they find out what my strengths are like if it's speaking or if it's dancing. They've made sure that I explore it and it helps them in a whole also because it increases the productivity of an organization. So yes, I have had such supervisors. I've had such mentors and I'm happy that they have helped me come out of my shell.
