Teenagers do not get a lot of sleep nowadays. This is because they tend to spend most of their hours in college or school studying and the remaining hours they tend to spend a lot of it on technology, gadgets, mobile phones, laptops, TV or whatsoever. It is important for them to get quality of sleep because in order to lead a happy and a healthy life they need to get enough amount of sleep. Without sleep they won't be active enough or fit enough the next day to attend lectures which will affect their studies itself. So in order for teenagers to make sure they get enough sleep, firstly they should reduce their screen timing and focus more on calming themselves before going to sleep so that they tend to fall asleep much faster than being on their phones watching movies because of which they don't get sleep. There have been a lot of cases where children don't sleep enough and there are a lot of health problems that also occur because of this issue. So it is encouraged that students should get at least 8 hours of sleep every day in order to lead a healthy life and focus on their goals.
