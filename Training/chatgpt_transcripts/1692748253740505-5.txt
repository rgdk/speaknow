I can say that I really love learning English when I was young. Because when I was around 6, I was in English class already. Because I love to learn new things, especially the new language. And I really need to learn the language. Because English is, you can say, a second language for Cambodian. So when we learn the language, it helps us to have a good job, communicate with the others. And to understand other people and cultures of another country also. I think when I was young, I can say that English is difficult for me. Since I have no idea what it is, how to learn it. But from time to time, I learn the new tips and techniques by myself. How do I learn the vocabulary? How do I learn the grammar? So I can improve. I can find my own learning style. And it gets easier from time to time.
