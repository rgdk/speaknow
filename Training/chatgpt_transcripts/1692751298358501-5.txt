Yes, I do think it is better to have many brothers and sisters. The advantages of having many brothers and sisters is that we can play together and grow, learn and be friends. You can never feel alone when you have many brothers and sisters. But there are also advantages of being an only child. You don't have to share your personal stuff with your own siblings. Also you can do whatever you like. I would like to have a small family because it is more manageable and it will be great for dealing everything with a small family.
