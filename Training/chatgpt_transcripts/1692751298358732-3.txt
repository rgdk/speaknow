The streets of Kolkata are clean and they are not clean at the same time. There are places where the streets are very very clean and also there are places where the streets are not clean, very unhygienic. And of course there are people who keep our, I mean if I talk about my area, yes there are people who come and they clean the area. They keep it neat and clean and of course there are people, as we live in a society it's our duty to keep our streets clean. So we try to keep it clean and we try to not throw garbage here and there. We try to keep it in a separate place so that we throw it when a person comes to take it away, to dump it to some other place where it's supposed to be dumped. And to keep the streets clean, first of all we should not throw away the things which we are carrying. Like if we are eating something after we are done eating, we should not throw it on the streets. We should search a place which is a dustbin to throw it away. If we do this then our streets will be very much clean and it will be very hygienic. It will not spread diseases. That's it.
