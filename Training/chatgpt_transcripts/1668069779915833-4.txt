Okay, so I definitely prefer to be remembered for great kindness because I'm more a people person. I believe to be kind to another. I believe to do good things to another, even if it's a completely stranger because to do good things for another, do much more good for the world instead of be smarter. You can be sophisticated and you can be very smart. It is useful, but I think in action to be kind, it's more valuable. And in my perspective, it's much better to be kind for another. So yeah, I definitely go for great kindness.
