I believe it's a very good idea to create a computer club for elderly people. Why? you ask. It's because the elderly people have been so disconnected with the society lately. They feel they cannot connect or feel the same things that today's generations do. They have lost touch with their friends who have moved away and haven't been talking in over 15 to 20 or even more years. So if the city council wants to create a computer club for the elderly people, first of all, they would learn a lot about technology which they are eager to learn about. They are even more eager than the younger generation to learn new stuff, new tech of this generation. What do they use the computers for? They could use the computers for a lot of things. They could use it to plan their traveling or get connected to their friends who are living far away and haven't spoken in years on end. They could learn the new tech of this world and feel a little connected to the society. Would I like to work as an instructor? Definitely. I love working with elderly people a lot. They make me very appreciative of all the things that life has given me. Also, spending time with elderly people as I have personally experienced gives you a lot of wisdom as well. Hence, it really makes me happy to be able to spend time with the elderly people, thus gaining the excessive wisdom of this world in order to walk through this rough life.
