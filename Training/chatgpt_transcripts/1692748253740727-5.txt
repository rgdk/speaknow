Well, I'm living in Cambodia which is a tropical country so the weather is hot and humid. Of course, I can say I like the weather here but not totally satisfied because for some months it can be super hot, it's boiling, it can reach for example 38 or 40 degrees which is really really hot that people can get sick and yeah, I normally don't go outside when it's too hot but still because I have to go to school or to work and to the market. And although it's not going outside, just staying at home, if the house doesn't fix with the aircon, it's still hot inside especially for the concrete house and living in the city is hotter than in the countryside because a lot of buildings now, high-rise buildings are increasing and trees are not a lot as before so yeah, it's really really really kind of dumb. I enjoy the weather which is, it's cooler, it's not cold but it's cool so I can sleep well and peacefully.
