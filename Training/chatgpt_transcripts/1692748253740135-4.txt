Well, one of my favourite teachers was the teacher who taught me when I was a second year student at my university. I think he was very friendly at that time, he was very helpful and he always gave me hands whenever I needed help or I didn't understand some points regarding my lessons. Basically he taught me about the globalisation at that time. That subject is pretty good, it's talking about some factors or problems regarding to the society at that time. And he taught that subject. I liked him because he was really helpful, he didn't only teach us what is in the book but also outside the book. He is a good teacher, he always shares good experiences and some other stuff related to the language since my first language is not English. So he not only teaches the context of the book but also some overall points regarding to the English usage, I mean the English language. So that's why I consider that he was one of the greatest teachers that I had during my university time since he helped me a lot. He was a wonderful teacher.
