I do think that parents should actively monitor the children's academic process and the reason for saying that is that children are not that age to be autonomous enough so they would benefit from some guidance in the areas where they're being challenged or where they're struggling and also they would need encouragement in areas where they are doing better because it could help improve their performance. My parents did not monitor my progress that much because they hadn't had the experience of studying in a school so they didn't know what to look for, they didn't know how to prioritize different aspects of my learning and how did it affect the way I did my studies? Well I could probably have been more successful and my education could have been more effective however I had some peers who had the privilege of having educated parents and I got guidance from them as well.
