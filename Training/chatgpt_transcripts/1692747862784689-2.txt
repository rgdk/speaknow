For me, personally I think both good CV and good interview are the best for looking for a job. It really depends. To make a good CV, you must have a good experience, a good experience, a good education, and a nice detail on the CV. And to make a good choice and to make a good interview, people will have to make the best first impression to the manager, and especially having a good attitude to the manager. But for me personally, I would choose a good CV because I can practice my interview for the next time for speaking to the manager and for the CV, I need to spend a lot of my experience to be good enough to put in my CV.
