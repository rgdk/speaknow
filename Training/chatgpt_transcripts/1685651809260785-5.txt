If I had my own business, maybe I will give people, for example, it would be a business of checking computers of the other people. I will do it because there are so many people that don't know about computers and maybe when the computer gets messed up they don't know how to repair it or maybe they don't know what the computer has and it would be an excellent service for some people that don't know about much computers. If I had to explain this, I would say that this business is so much rentable and you have so many benefits, not only for me, it would have benefits for the other people too because it would have a repairing computer service.
