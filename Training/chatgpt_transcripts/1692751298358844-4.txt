There are good teachers, yes, you will find them, but for that you have to attend classes regularly. Otherwise you won't know who is good and who is bad for you. For me, a good teacher is the one who can read you by just looking at you. He or she will know anything about you without your saying. And the bad teachers, I would say, are the ones who just want to steal your knowledge just for the sake of teaching. You are just giving them, taking something from them. There is no exchange of ideas. You just spend too much time with them, and they are the bad teachers. If I talk about my favorite school teacher, he was a Purnima Chakra Pratishar. He was so good, he was, you know, such a good and helpful teacher. Everyone enjoyed his class very much. And in between all his classes, he used to write some stories, which gave his help, getting more attention from the students. And he also taught us manners, like when he used to teach us inside the class, we all used to speak for him. And he used to say, Good morning, Sir. And when he used to leave the class, we used to again stand and we used to say to him, Thank you, Sir. This was really, I think, a basic manner that we should know what he used to do and he taught us. Also, even now, even after passing out of school, if I feel, if I catch him on messaging, I can, without any hesitation, I can text him.
