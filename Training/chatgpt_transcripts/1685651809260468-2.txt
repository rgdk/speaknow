I think they have to be together because you can learn things about the other people. If you're a woman, you will learn things about a man, like they fight skills or something like that. I think the good part is, like I said, you can learn things about other people. And the bad part is that we don't have the same ideas. We don't have the same ideas, that's it. The good part of being separate is you have the same ideas as the other girls or the other boys. And the bad part of being separate is like, yeah, you will separate. You're not going to know things about the other gender. That's it.
