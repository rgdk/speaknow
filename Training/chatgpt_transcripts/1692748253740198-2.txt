Well, there are a lot of jobs that young people can actually go for in my city now. And for those who are actually young, they can do part-time jobs like teaching foreign language like Chinese or English because it doesn't require a lot of experience while you're going to a very basic school that offer like a limited range of salary. And it doesn't require a lot of like well-rounded experience for doing that. And the other interesting job and also popular job also is the delivery industry like a food delivery or a package delivery. It gives them a lot of opportunities that they can do flexible hours. They can just if you're free from school, they can do it as a part-time job anywhere they want. It's just a piece of cake to turn on the apps and receive the order and they just go and pick up food or other item for delivery. And they can do it at their own will. If they do a lot of work, they do a lot of hours, they can make more money. If they are busy with their study, they just turn off the app so you don't have to go online. It's not really difficult. It depends but mostly it's more about safety during the work. The difficulty is not much because just carrying stuff in just one way to make money with the commission that the company gives. But the thing is safety because delivery people, they have to drive very fast and sometimes they have to cut the traffic in order to make sure that the food reach the customer's chill or if it's something hot, they have to ride hot. Some customer probably, if they order the food hot and it arrives cold, they probably reject the food and that they lose the money. I've never done that job before and I think I don't want to do it because it's easy but it's really dangerous. I don't want to lose my life because of it.
