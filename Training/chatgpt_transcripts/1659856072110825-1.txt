Health and well-being is important at the workplace because health and well-being provide a safe environment and a productive environment for those who are at work with you. You wouldn't want your coworkers to not be involved in healthy habits because you want to be influenced by good people who are going to be around you. When I was beginning a job one time, somebody started smoking around me and that was something which was very hard for me. My employer brings in a dog to the office and I happen to be allergic. These are unhealthy habits for me and therefore I would rather that workplace habits be healthy and safe for all.
