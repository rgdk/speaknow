The best way to hire employees is for them to go through a series of application screenings. For example, first of all, they would submit their CV and we have to take a look at their background of the CV. And after that, we also need to analyze their personality test as well. So I believe that they are quite useful because sometimes people could just simply put anything in the CV or their cover letter. And then in the personality test, maybe they will have to read some scenario and decide which one is the best that fits them. So the result could actually give us a big picture of their personality. And then after their personality test, maybe the next step, I think it's for them to do the group interview. So I also believe that they are kind of somewhat useful because this is like too challenging. Like most of the time, they only do individual interview and putting them in group would mean that they have to challenge another and try to bring out or to say what is the best for them. And then after the group interview, I think another screening method is for them to sit the test. For example, let's say they are applying for an accounting position. So of course, maybe they have to sit on a test and do the accounting stuff and see what it turns out, whether or not they know about the accounting that they are applying for.
