Living in a house is easier than living in an apartment because it doesn't have so many floors. Living in an apartment is very difficult because you have to climb up the stairs from one place to another. In my country, which is Cambodia, most people live in houses because houses are much easier to build and they're cheaper. Now currently I'm living in a house. I share the house with my family and also my extended family members. I prefer to live in a house because we can have a barbecue outside the house and it's convenient for children to run around and play with their peers.
