I think children should not be allowed to have smartphones until they are 11 or 12 and that's by By having smartphones I mean Having it Unsupervised so they could probably have access to smartphones in a supervised way from the age of four or five with the help of parents they can send text messages to family or relatives or They could use it for play games on apps and things like that but if the use is going to be unsupervised, I don't think it is going to be any time before the age of 12 and that's when they are Moving out and about a bit more freely however The type of smartphone that I think would be best suited for a 12 year old girl or boy Is a smartphone that would not have any internet access
