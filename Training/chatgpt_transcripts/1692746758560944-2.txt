In our point of view, when we are at work, we also meet many different kinds of people. Sometimes we meet a person that always have a bad mood and a good mood. So, we should have a kind of wisdom and always have a good communication with each other. And a kind of person that we prefer not to work with, when they always have a bad mood. And we didn't do anything but they always have a bad mood. So, I think we should then work with them. And to have a good work, we should have a good mood and always have a good communication with our colleagues. That's it.
