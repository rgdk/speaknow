My best teacher was maybe, I don't know, my first teacher in primary. She has a lot of patience and creativity, and she has so many equipment or tools for learning, and she has freedom in her class. She has a lot of knowledge about science and different things, and maybe another of my teachers was Arnaldo Corva, the personality of a human personality class, and he has discipline and he has a lot of knowledge too, like my other teacher, and he was the Ruth, Ruth, yes? Because he has a lot of maybe discipline, or I don't know, he worries about our knowledge, he worries about our learning, and he has a different kind of practice, and sociodramatic practice, and the class was really, really fun and really, really tense in some cases, because he was with a whole group, and they had a lot of, I don't know, I don't know.
