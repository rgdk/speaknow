think artists nowadays get their hands around the money which they deserve not all of it but a limited amount of it so I don't think that every mode of music every music platform needs a way where artists can be fed and I don't think government needs to be involved in this this is something a more of a social issue more of a artist and fan issue and it should be solved in that criteria
