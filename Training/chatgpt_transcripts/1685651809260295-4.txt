I think that boys and girls should be in the same school. Why? Because that way you can meet more people of different genders and even gain a partner of some sorts, like a boyfriend or a girlfriend. The bad part of this would be that sometimes girls and boys can do some very bad stuff that is not appropriate for school and that would be punishable.
