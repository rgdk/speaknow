So, the next weekend, a friend of mine who is living in the United Kingdom, in London, is coming to Lithuania, to Vilnius. His parents and his brother are living here in Vilnius. So from time to time, he's traveling from London to Vilnius just to visit the parents, the family and also friends. So, next weekend, on Saturday, he also will meet his friends. He was my classmate, so I think like five, maybe even more people are going to gather in the town center in Vilnius. So we will go to have a dinner in some restaurant and later on we will go most likely to some bars or pubs just to have some good time.
