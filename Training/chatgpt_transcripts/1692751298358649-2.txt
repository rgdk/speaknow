According to me the most important jobs nowadays are a doctor, a journalist and and politicians maybe. They are the most important ones because doctor obviously because they are angel in forms of human. They save lives of people. Journalists because they provide us with a lot of news also. I'm trying to be a journalist so yeah I find that job important. Okay next one is politician because they all they are important even if you don't want them to be important but they are still important. You want one of these jobs? Yes I said as I said I'm going to be like I'm studying journalism in law school so I feel like I am going to be a good journalist or maybe something in that industry.
