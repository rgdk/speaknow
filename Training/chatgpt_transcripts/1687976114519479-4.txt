If I start my own business it will be a cafeteria. I will do it because that's my dream like when I was a kid. And I know it's not something too big for a business but if this is my first business I'm going to do it. Then I'm going to gain money and start with something more bigger. I would like to do a veterinarian too to help animals and rescue animals in the street.
