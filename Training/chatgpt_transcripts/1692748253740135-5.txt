Well, I do enjoy learning English since it is the second language in my country. Basically, compared to my language which is Khmer, I think English is much more easier to study than Khmer. Because both in speaking and writing. Basically in writing. Writing in Khmer, we need to do a lot of stuff. Because one character is separate to different kinds. But in English, no. That is it. It's it. And it's much more to remember to write. That's why I think it's much more enjoyable than studying my language. I need to study English since in my country, they like value the second language that you know in using in the work environment. For example, if you want to be an English teacher, you need to know how to use English. Pretty good, right? So, I think this is very crucial to me that I need to study English. Moreover, I want to go abroad. So, basically for foreigners from every country, they must know how to use English in any countries. Because I think it is not the second language for each country. But I think it is the global language which every country need to use it to communicate in any context that they want to talk about. I think English is kind of 50-50. I think it's half difficult and half it isn't. It depends on our practicing. The more we practice, the more we know about English. And we need to spend a lot of time either way. Moreover, we need to have a good mentor or tutor or teacher in order to correct our mistakes. Because we are not perfect. We are human beings. We are not perfect, right? So, we need to develop ourselves and we need someone to look at our mistakes and to correct us so that we can be even more better for next time.
