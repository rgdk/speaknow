Using email is very beneficial. We can deliver our message to whomever we want very quickly. However, there is a risk of scam and virus that comes with emails. And by not sending letters and cards, we will become more robotic. Our life will become more mechanical. I think there is joy in sending a letter to a loved one and waiting for their response. There is a joy in waiting as well that emails don't offer. And yes, I would like to send a card to one of my best friends. I miss her. She lives far away. And I think I'll send her letter to her after finishing this exam.
