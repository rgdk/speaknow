People should stop working at 60 years old and it's maybe a good thing for older people to keep working because they have many experience. Also, they have got a lot of an idea to share with other people. For example, the teacher who keeps teaching the students because they were in the old age. I don't think that I keep working in the old age because I want to take my time to go to another country, to visit another country, and to make my old age very happy and enjoy with the last time after.
