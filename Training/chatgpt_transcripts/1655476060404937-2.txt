My favorite social media platform that I prefer is Facebook. I prefer it because there is a lot of things that you can see from comedy shows that you can laugh and relax at the end of the day and also you can look for work. That's how I found this job. There's a lot of opportunities to see outside of your own eyes, to open your mind, to see other things that you might be curious about. That's why I prefer that platform. Also I can put and use this platform and also keep my privacy. I can choose whatever I want to show, I can choose whatever I want to see and that's why I prefer that.
