Australia is a large country. It has a vast landscape and it has got different geographical conditions and the landscape allows building different types of dwellings. What we can see from looking at the Australian cities and rural areas, you can see that there isn't a huge amount or a huge number of apartments available in Australia. So I would say that probably the most common type of housing in Australia is detached or semi-detached houses. Where I would prefer to live, I think I would prefer to live in a detached house surrounded by a garden area. The main reason being I love gardening. The other reason is that all my life before I moved to Australia I used to live in an apartment. So I know for a fact that I was never a big fan of living in an apartment, living in a space that is confined and strained. And I also enjoy gardening.
