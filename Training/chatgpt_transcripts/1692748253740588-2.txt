Okay, so talking about the culture of looking for a job, I think it can be quite challenging in my country for a person to look for a job. Well, the factor could be variously depending on the qualification, the condition, and where they're from and stuff like that. For some cases, people are not really qualified for the job due to their background. For instance, they're from the organization which isn't well-known enough, and when it comes to applying for the job in a big company or organization, usually their resume, their CV are being underestimated or overlooked by the employer.
