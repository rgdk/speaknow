What advice I will give to a new worker in the office? So I think it will be to work hard, not to gossip. It's very, I believe, important not to get into the, you know, to weigh with other people. I think you should be focused in your work. Again, work hard, achieve milestones, be curious. It's very important. Be involved with all the activities. Don't be small head in a way, like become involved in each aspect along the R&D and the team. Try to learn about other activities around you and not focus only on what you need to do because it's a piece of puzzle. And overall, what we do here is a big story and you need to know the overall picture and not be focused only on the small thing that you do. So I think it will give you more motivation and more enthusiastic to be aware to what other people do and to work together with the team. It's also nicer when you work with other people and get positive interaction with friends in the team, but not too much. Again, I said not to be influenced by others and not gossip or be politically involved with the situation in work. Good luck.
