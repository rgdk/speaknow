Sometimes the government does control social media and ban it because it might cause lots of problems in the society. It might, um, content which is really, which is against people might be posted and that would affect the way people think. In one way it does deprive the right to freedom of speech as people cannot express their opinion because they're scared it might hurt someone's feelings. Usually the government regulates social media in my country. A few of the social media platforms that are restricted in our country, one of them being TikTok, it was restricted for reasons, um, like safety issues and for things which are said against the country. So to prevent people from getting hurt and to prevent spreading false information about different things and about the government, the government of India has banned a few media platforms. So, um, I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing. I don't know if it's a bad thing.
