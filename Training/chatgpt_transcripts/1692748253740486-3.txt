Having security cameras installed in public places does help a lot in preventing a lot of potential crimes and also dealing with something like a case of accidents happening on the road. I believe that having them is good but at the same time there should be places which are not allowed to have the security cameras installation. For example, I think it's in the public toilet, public restroom. Probably we can have it installed outside but not inside the toilet or the restroom directly because it would be very privacy violating and also inconvenient for the people to use the restroom inside.
