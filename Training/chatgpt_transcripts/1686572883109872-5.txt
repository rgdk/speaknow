I don't think that celebrities like actors or professional athletes should be held to different standards of behaviour, comparing from those of the general public because we are all humans and we all have human rights. So I do believe that we all should be held to the same standards of behaviour. Even though those celebrities are well known, they have a lot of followers, they should show good examples, but still I do believe that we are all human, we are all the same and the standards should be similar for all of us.
