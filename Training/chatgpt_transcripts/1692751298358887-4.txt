The benefits of eating or drinking in class is to maintain their concentration. Sometimes when we are hungry or when we are thirsty, it's very difficult for us to focus on the teacher or the professor. But if we have enough break times in between, just so we can replenish our hunger and our thirst in order to restore our confidence and concentration on the topic, it will be very beneficial for the students as well as the teacher. However, there are some drawbacks as well. Some students take advantage of the leniency that some schools show about the eating and drinking in class. They try to sneak in food while the professor is teaching or the teacher is teaching and without permission, they would just sneak food in and eat it during class which also causes a lot of distraction to the other students who are trying to focus. It also shows or reflects disrespect to the teacher who is teaching. That is, the student has been eating without permission which shows that a student doesn't care about the respect for his teacher. Were you allowed to eat or drink in class? I wasn't allowed during my school time. However, there were some teachers. Although the school did not have a very prominent rule for it, some teachers did allow us to eat lest we ask permission for it. So, if we did, they would let us eat for five to ten minutes or drink water. Although, drinking water did not require a lot of permission because drinking water is a necessity. But eating did require a permission level and we respected our teachers enough to ask them before drinking or eating food or water in the class during their teaching.
