It's uh an old sci-fi uh series about uh a group of um interesting um, and different characters, uh coming together, um, on the journey first place. Uh I really like it. Uh, mainly because it's a sci-fi, uh it's a safe series which Charlie genuinely enjoy. Um And uh because of the cast of the aforementioned characters, um, the show is not really popular in my country because it is, I don't think it has ever been translated to Russian. So I have only seen it in English. And, uh, yeah, that's about it.","Uh, there are actually many different jobs I don't appreciate. Uh, but on the top of them all stands the uh retail sales worker. So, uh it's a job which I never want to do. Uh, and I think the worst part of it is, uh, that usually, uh, people are quite disingenuous with the product they are selling, uh which they usually are required by the companies they work for, to push on to other people. This, despite the, sometimes people clear disinterest in the product they are selling. Um, I think that, um, people choose those jobs. Um, people choose that kind of job usually because it pays well and um, with a good amount of sales per month you can get quite a lot of money.","Uh, I consider charity organizations important, uh, because there are a lot of different, uh, problems which we as humankind face, uh, in different countries and different situations, uh, all around the world. Uh, and each of those organizations kind of handles, uh, some of the, uh, some of the issues which we may have, uh, I don't know any popular charities in my country, uh, to be honest. And, uh, I have never, um, supported in any monetary form, uh, any of the charities because I am not really, uh, self sufficient right now. Unfortunately.","I, I think that the home schooling becomes uh became really popular lately because of the convenience. Uh it's extremely easy to keep your child around but also to uh provide them with uh education because of the internet because of the online courses, um applications like uh uh uh and other communications uh communication systems. Uh Do you mean advantage again, would be the convenience of the uh of the, of providing information for the internet to the uh Children? And uh generally the amount of information they can access through internet. Uh The main disadvantage would be, I guess uh the surrounding uh surroundings and the um yeah, the, the surroundings of the student, uh personally, I don't think I would educate my child at home. I would prefer for them to receive their education in the proper facility. So to say.","I consider studying foreign languages. Uh really important. Uh I believe uh I believe that nowadays people should learn at least on foreign language because uh as we go forward as a species, we need to the projects. So which uh different countries start together uh will require all forms of communication. And uh different languages are must for efficient and uh convenient for, to communicate conveniently and efficiently with each other. Um So the main benefit, uh in my opinion, uh for studying uh foreign languages is uh lies in the fact that it opens, you know, foreign language opens you a lot of new opportunities, opens a lot of new doors which you can walk through. Uh as for the most important foreign language to learn, I consider English to be one of the most uh important languages. So as it is the most widespread and the easiest one to learn among all of the languages in the world."

And one of them in is the ability to, to see things that we miss in our parents and, or grand fathers and people we, that we just sell in the family and bonds and see them. It's a great pleasure that we can in this occasion ask them questions that we always want to ask them. Yeah.","I prefer to be most remembered for my great wisdom, not my great candace. There are several reasons for this. First, I would like to contribute to to the knowledge and to enable to help people to overcome some problems and I need I need wisdom, not a kindness in order to accomplish that. Um Second, I think people will appreciate more people that contributed to the, in to the humanity in general, um to all human being um rather than just be kind because being kind is restricted to one period of life and contributing to knowledge is something that you can like have effect. Kevin has effects for the several generations.","I prefer to be the first person to explore a planet rather than being the inventor of a drug that cures the disease. Um I can think about two main reasons for doing that. The first reason is that I read a lot of science fiction novels in in in my childhood, I would be happy the first man to step in one place. In furthermore. I think there are a lot of things that we can discover in pure new planet. It's great um adventure that I would not miss in any case. Um The other thing is I'm not uh physics, so I will not invent a drug that can cure deadly disease. So I will let it. I leave it to other people that are more professional than me in this aspect.",I think there should be restrictions for publishing um information in the social media. Um The first reason of that is um we can control fake news that can damage not just communities and individuals but also companies and um families and a lot larger groups of people. And should I put should find a solution for this and provide people just a flight information that is trusted and they will get benefit of reading this information. Um I think it's a matter. Um We should not provide any information that that should that could offend people because people are the users of social um social media platform and we should provide them the best service that we can offer.,"Yeah, I prefer to be remembered for my great wisdom and there are several, several reasons for this first. People will remember smart people that have changed the world, people that contributed to the knowledge in in general. And if if you are like kind with people, it's good. It's a positive feature to have, but it will affect just few people. And when you have a great wisdom you can have a larger effect. You might affect family and communities and maybe in countries and I prefer to um, and have a large effect in the world."

It would be quite difficult for social media companies to um, to actually verify that everything is true. I think that verify truth today has become a bit of a slippery slope term. It would be quite challenging for a company to have to take it upon themselves to define whether or not a piece of information is true, so whether or not I agree with this statement, I think the implementing implementation of it would be far more challenging.","As a student for an All girls high school, I am very pleased that I studied um, in an All Girls high school. I think girls and women uh benefit far more from it being a separate sex, separate gender classrooms. I think that in in um, in lower school years it might be beneficial to be in a co ed classrooms, so that might be a consideration to take into account. Boys might feel differently about this. But but from my personal opinion, I believe that women and girls should study separately."

I don't think that you can judge a person based on just one meeting. I think that you have to see a person in a multitude of various contexts in order to see what they're like in different situations before you can really get a whole picture of the person. Uh Just as an example, I could think of people that I work with who may seem a bit standoffish or reserved, but that's just their office persona. You meet them outside of work in a more social setting and you get to see them more comfortable and come alive. And in fact, find out that the person that you thought was a bit rude or dismissive or condescending is actually quite warm, affectionate and affable once you get them in the right context. So it's, it's really not a great idea to judge someone based on the first impression that you get of them.","I think that there are several significant factors that a person should consider before selecting a job. Uh I would say that the three most critical components in no specific order would be salary. Uh passion and location. I mentioned salary obviously because you need remuneration for any job and the remuneration needs to be commensurate with the lifestyle that you want to lead. I would say that passion is important because it's really hard to continue with the job that you don't care about or that doesn't really appeal to you. And then I would mention location as well. Uh I mentioned it last, not because it's least important, but being able to access your job site conveniently and quickly, actually, I think improves a worker's overall job satisfaction and it doesn't matter how good the job is. If you spend an inordinate amount of time or money on fuel to get to that location.","No, in my opinion, I do not think that there is any sort of moral duty for a professional athlete to be an upstanding citizen or a role model for anyone. Uh While I do think that it would be ideal for a professional athlete to inspire people to have better standards or to behave like better citizens. That's not really part of their job asking a professional athlete to uh to always be law abiding upstanding and some sort of bastion of civilization isn't really commensurate with the job that they've been hired to do, which is physical exertion. Uh So an athlete shouldn't have that role more than say a teacher should be responsible for following traffic laws. Precisely. It's just, uh it's, it's not what they are hired to do while they can inspire while they can be role models. Why they can't advocate for good causes. That is great, but that is not part of their job description. So I do not find that it would be part of their obligation.","This is quite an interesting question. There are a lot of facets to address, but I guess I would say if I were the Minister of Education in the current country that I reside in some of the changes that I would make would primarily be to expand the access of education for all Children and to make quality education more affordable. Uh There is high quality education available, but I find that that's limited to a certain segment of society. And really you want all people in the society to have equal access to quality education as that improves the society overall and also make sure that you don't have any segments that are perpetually disenfranchised or unable to reach their full potential. Uh I actually think that that would be my priority. I would like to lower school fees. I would like to lower the cost of books. I would like to lower the cost of uniforms. I think that people regardless of their financial background or their family standing should have access to the same high quality of education. Well, I think that it would be common sense or easy to make decisions such as that you have to realize that there are differing opinions and varied moneyed interests that are always going to be involved in any system, whether that be health care, uh transportation or education. So you'll have to contend with different viewpoints and different interests. And I do think that that could make uh finding or achieving a resolution relatively difficult, even for some of the most common sense solutions. What makes me happy about the present situation in the country that I'm in is that each year there seems to be progress. We're not really where we need to be just yet. But each year you can see incrementally that we're getting closer to making education attainable for all people, regardless of their income.","I think that environmental crises are caused by, by two primary factors. One would obviously be the climate and the second would be the humans who live on this earth. Um I guess what I mean to say is that you have certain climate events like sorry, certain climactic events like tornadoes or hurricanes and those have existed for as long as we know, but the crisis is caused when these come into conflict, sorry, conflict with human civilization. Hurricane that makes landfall where there are no homes isn't really a crisis. So it's really a combination of not just the events but these events happening in places where humans have decided to make settlements. Uh It's not really a matter of responsibility. I think this is just the way that that things are on earth. Uh The way that we can overcome some of these crises though I believe would be better planning. There are some areas that are really not suited for inhabitants. Uh whether that is the coastline which is subject to erosion and vicious storms, or if we're talking about building settlements on steep embankments in countries that have prolific rainy seasons which often end in mudslides. So I think we may be able to manage our settlements and our habitations a bit better. And I also think that there is some significant work we can do with stopping climate change or not so much stopping climate change, but maybe making a significant reduction in the speed of climate change by reducing our usage of fossil fuels, namely."

And of course, you will get a lot of benefits with your apartment. Like there can be more safety, security guards and also you have neighbors to interact with.

But when they are in the elder phase of their life, when they are getting old, their capability decreases. No, I don't think that I will keep working when I'm old because I will like to enjoy my time after getting old being with my family. Because after working from, since your adulthood, until you reach your old age, it is better that you spend now quality time with your friends and family because you have been working since a long time.

However, I think it's fine if we don't have to wear sneakers because we don't have money to buy those sneakers. We can just wear any other shoe like sandals or flip flops. However, there are some rules that it's not ok to break. For example, like if you kill someone, if you do something that harm others, those kind of things are never ok to break.

So, it's, it's a better idea to find good friends rather than just having a lot of friends who are always asking you to go out to the nightclub or drinking beers every time and like to spend a lot of money. So, it's a, it's a good to have a good friend. Thank you so much.","Um, of course, people um have, yeah, people uh start schools at the early age and finish school and they get around 22 years old, finish bachelor degree and then they need to go to work to earn a living. And when they go to work, they will be so busy with their work and have less time with their uh life, let's say, have less time with their family and friends. So how can they balance between their personal life and work? They need to know how to balance their time. Uh To me, I believe that um after working, I can chat with my friends through social media so that I can keep in touch with them. So, uh I will have, I will maintain all my friends. They will not go away from me even though we are all so busy with our work. We still can keep in touch or some, let's say at the weekend, we might go cycling together or eating out together to uh to build up a relationship as a team building. So that we don't, we are not so obsessed with our work. We also have some time to enjoy our life with friends, relatives and family. Yeah. So to me, I, I do believe that, uh, if I balance the, my personal life and work, well, I will enjoy my life. I will enjoy it. I believe so. Thank you so much.","I remember when I went to with my family's members and I, I, I never been there. So I drove a car and I hardly find a place to go to. I mean, I, I hardly find the right place to go. For example, if I want to go to a temple, I don't know where to go. So I mostly I asked my wife to use Google map to find a way to any places that you want to go to because there are a lot of temples to visit. So we look at the Google map to find the place and it allows us to get to the direction that we want to. Normally, I went to a temple and then we go to have lunch and move on to temple and other temples. But because we cannot find easily. So we don't usually go to many temples. We mostly we go to, to a temple and Bayon temple and walking in the a temple. It's, it's easy to get lost because it's so big and the architecture and let's say the structure, the inside the temple is so complicated. If you were alone, you might get lost I mean, I, I already experienced that. I, normally when I go, I work in groups so that we will not get lost. If we, if anyone get lost, it's hard to find each other. It's hard to find him or her because the temple is so big. Thank you so much.","Um monitoring children's academic progress is very important to me. I believe they should, that they should, I think they must monitor their students, their children's academic progress because they send uh let the parents send their kids to the good schools. Let's just say like a ce a ist or some even send their kids to the even more better school like South Bridge, North Bridge footprint uh ISP P and the reason is because they want to, their kids to have a better education, to have a good education for their future. So if they wanted it, they should look at their Children academic progress and they need to have them at home, look at uh their activities at home. Do they do their homework? Do they spare some time to review the lesson? Do they spare some time to book or do they just play a game all the time? Yeah. So the parents must play an important role to monitor their Children, academic progress. Maybe they can have a good contact with the teachers or uh academic officer at the school so that they can know the progress of their kids. To me. Uh parents play a very important role in helping the kids to reach their academic goals.","When talking about recycling. Not many people know what it is. I mean, they know, but they, they don't really know the importance because uh because Cambodia, let's say the old people, elderly people, the did not good uh didn't get good education when they were young because of the poor, poor regime. And because of the war and now teachers start to uh provide good education to the young generation so they could learn more about recycling as well. However, there are, there is no, let's say the encouragement from the government, the government does not play any role in helping them to know the importance of recycling what we look at nowadays. Uh people start to recycle because they know some Vietnamese people walking along the street with a car to buy all rec recyclable material like they say, hih, I, so when they walk along the street, they will buy uh use uh papers, use cans, bottles. Yeah. Uh so that they can sell to H I and they bring them to Vietnam to um make them into a new material from the recyclable materials. So I think Cambodian people know about recycle from Vietnamese. Hih, I they are walking along the street with the car to like to buy the used material from people all over Cambodia. So thank you so much to Vietnamese people who started the recycle recycling ideas in Cambodia."
1692748253740912,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,"I, I think we should try to narrow the gap between the have and the have nots because uh this is to reduce um the the inequality in the society. Like if for example, let's say, um we have a big gap between the rich and the poor and, and let's say the rich will just become richer and richer, whereas the poor will become poorer and poorer. So the poor might see it as um a very unfair society that they are currently living in. So of course, um in order to become transparent about that, uh we should try to narrow the gap and then maybe um the society could create employment, especially for the unemployed or those who are poor, like try to provide them a job instead of uh let them be unemployed. And the government need to uh make sure that there a very stable political society probably like there is no uh unrest, political unrest in the country that they are living in. For example, in Myanmar, there's always um a fight between the government and their citizens. So it seems like it's not um ideal. So yeah,","The best way to hire employees is for them to go through a series of um application screening. For example, first of all, they would submit their CV. And we have to take a look at their uh background of the CV. And after that, they, we also uh the, we also need to analyze the uh personality test as well. So I believe that they are quite useful because um some people could just simply put anything in the CV or their cover letter and then in the personality test and maybe they will have to read, read some scenario and decide which one is um the best that fits them. So the result could actually give us a big picture of their personality. And then for after their personality test, maybe the next step, uh I think it's for them to do the group interview. So I also believe that they are kinda somewhat useful because um this is like to challenge, like most of the time they only do individual interview and putting them in growth would mean that um they have to challenge another and try to bring out or to say what is the best for them. And then after the uh group interview, I think another screening method is for them to sit the test. For example, let's say they are applying for an accounting position. So of course, maybe they have to sit uh on a test and do the accounting stuff and see um what it turned out like whether they, whether or not they know about the accounting that they are applying for.","International media is very important to every country. Maybe first of all, let us talk about the advantages first. So um international media allow, allow people to um see what is happening outside their own country. Like local media is good, but international media could just open people's eyes to the outside world, could expose them to what is happening like in terms of political, in terms of um so social, in terms of technology use, like see what the world is like. And this could help people to be open mind, to be open minded, to accept the new changes. But uh it also could have the disadvantages because somehow we are exposed to something that is not very useful or something that is harmful to our society. Um Maybe somehow we adopt uh the wrong idea because maybe different country, they have different um situations. So somehow what we see from the other country could not be applicable to what we could do in our own country. To me, I follow a lot of media from the other country, especially the uh country with democracy, for example, like South Korea, the United States, because my country is quite Communist and I want to learn about democracy and freedom from the other countries. Yeah.","Lately, the role of the teachers have changed a lot. Um as a result of the technology. First of all, let us talk about um how technology has helped the student. So in the past, most student rely a lot on the teacher, like in case that they have any question they would ask the teacher. But nowadays, with the advance of technology, for example, we have the internet where the student can get access to and do their own research. So somehow it could um to have like turn the burden of the teacher, like the student did not have to rely a lot on the teacher and the teacher as well. Um Also feel less pressure, for example, in terms of marking and doing assessment or giving assessment to student. In the past, they would have to do it manually, like marking the students uh paper and stuff. But now maybe they can just uh assign uh a link of the exercise and maybe they can post, post it in um a digital platform and they still then complete it by themselves and it just auto automatically map by itself. So this could have the teacher to um reduce their paperwork. But I also believe that there could be also the drawback of the technology because, um, we have robots and we believe that one day the robot will replace the teacher. So somehow, uh, the teacher could be in a dangerous position of losing their job of the, the job in the future. But again, um, whether there's a robot or not, I think we still need, um, teacher because they could understand, um, the feelings and what the student needs rather than a robot who simply do not have emotion to understand the people's needs.","Yes, I do believe that government have the right to, uh, actually force people to do things for safety because the government care about uh, our safety. So that's why they could, uh, implement any measures to force us to do that. Maybe let us talk about, um, safety on the road. So in Cambodia, uh people are forced to strictly abide by the rule. For example, they have to wear a helmet all of the time, regardless whether they are using motorbikes or bikes, they have to wear a helmet in case that they do not wear it. Um, they will be, they will receive punishment, for example, maybe fine of 10 or $20 if they are found to not wear the helmet. So actually the rule is good. It's kind of the, the people kind of feel forceful. But again, um, this is just for our own safety. So regardless of that, I think they have the right to do so."

For example, a person that might be meeting new people in their workplace or educational institute might come off it off putting or shy or not quite interesting due to their own dilemmas and thoughts. But once that, uh once we get to know them, they're the most interesting person we have met. So it's all about perception and getting to know a person by giving them the time to explain themselves. Not quite judging them on the first impression.","Hm. And uh in my opinion, the characteristic of a good colleague is first of all, uh one of the most characters, uh uh one of the most important characteristic for anyone in the workplace to, uh which is to basically have their own boundaries and understand and respect the boundaries of other people. A team player who understands that gossiping and workplaces crossing each other's boundaries is wrong and one who's who strives to being disciplined while at the same time being understanding of the other person is a kind of a person that I would like to work with. The, the entirely opposite are the people that I would not like to work with. People who do not take up initiatives, do not understand each other's boundaries, do not communicate well and therefore lead to gossip, other kinds of people that would make a to workplace inherently toxic.","CCTV is present all around us and they help us uncover mysteries and crimes that once was not possible for us or the police itself. CCTV has been such a great aid to the police and to the crime department. However, I do believe there should be a limit to where CCTV S are placed. Public places are, are 100% ok to have CCTV cameras. However, I think a private places such as inside of a restaurant or a private lounge or inside uh public and private bathrooms, this is definitely a play station where cameras should not be placed because once these protests get out of hand, this can definitely be misused. Apart from that, I do not believe that cameras violate anybody's privacy provided that they are in the correct person's hands and not leaked out of the government's.","I definitely firmly believe that foreign language should be taught in elementary school. Children's brains are like worms for knowledge. And I think this curiosity should be filled with the correct kind of information being bilingual or Multilingual is almost common, common almost everywhere now. And I think learning foreign languages in elementary school will not only help increase the person's educational knowledge, be a good point in their CV, but rather be a creative exercise for their mind. Children are amazing creatures with wonderful minds and I think their minds should be filled with knowledge and information such as language which uh which really works the brain. And as I've read, read from many researches and studies, the 1st 10 to 15 years of a children's life are known as a learning stage for knowledge, especially languages. During that time, students can eas uh Children can easily learn any language without having to put an extra effort. However, after 15, that becomes really difficult. Thus, I think elementary school students should definitely learn foreign languages in high school.","I think the issue of environmental crisis is not an issue where you can point fingers to each other and say that so and so person is responsible for a particular crisis. Environmental crisis is a wide topic. Some of the other person is some or the other in some of some of the other way responsible for some sort of environmental crisis, sort of almost sort of like a butterfly effect. But I do believe that while uh while the population does things that necessarily might contribute to environmental crisis, the bigger burden here is on the major corporations that do not follow the rules and regulations required. I mean, I as a person might leave my lives on in a room for one or one or two hours and that might contribute to the environment in some of the other way. However, it is definitely not comparable to the amount to the vast amount of industrial exploitation with the environment going on. So I think this is a matter in which we should not point fingers to each other, but rather take steps equally and bigger people should take bigger steps. So the major corporations should take bigger steps to overcome this particular environmental crisis."

But for that you have to attend classes regularly. Otherwise, you know, for me, a good teacher is the one who can avoid, you know, by just looking at 30211, anything about you without your say, they had the bad teachers as they had the one who just went to college, just of teaching, not just giving them taking something from that. There is no exchange of ideas. They just spend to spend some time. I think they have the packages. Um, if I talk about my favorite school teacher, he was a good, he was so good king of humor. Snatch it and had everyone enjoyed his class much. And in the beginning of his class, he used to attract some short stories which help getting more attention from the students. And he also taught us manners. Like when we used to speak for the class, we all used to stood for him and used to stay the new or, and when he used to, used to stay and we still see him.

What we can see from um from looking at the the Australian cities and rural areas, you can see that there isn't a huge amount or a huge number of apartments available in Australia. So I would say that probably the most common type of housing in Australia is detached, semi-detached houses where I would prefer to live. I think I would prefer to live in a detached house surrounded by a garden area. Um The main reason being I love gardening. The other reason is that all my life before I moved to Australia, I used to live in an apartment. So uh I know for a fact that I was never a big fan of living in an apartment uh living in a space that is uh confined and straight and uh I also enjoy gardening.","One of the jobs that I would probably despise doing is the job of a real estate agent. No, it looks like a lucrative job and there is a certain level of excitement in it because you've got um to be smart and it's quite a big challenge to convince people to pay huge amounts of money for a property, a piece of land, a flat or apartment or a house. So from the outside, it looks to be quite an exciting job. And also when you look at state agents look quite glitzy and glamorous, why I think it's not a good job because it does involve a lot of um playing a lot, a lot of tricks on people, both the customers and the vendors or those who are selling their, their properties. And this involves using intricate strategies to um lead people to believe that what they are paying is worth paying or what they're being paid is good value.

So, if the computer room was to be built and we had to choose between an older person or, um, a first grader, I would probably say I would build it for the older people because they belong to a group of people who have had less access to computers or less exposure to computers and could benefit from having better access or having some computer lessons or having some help handy.

My parents did not monitor my progress that much because they hadn't had the experience of studying in this school. So they didn't know what to look for.

Uh, with the help of parents, they can send text messages to family or relatives or they could use it for play games on apps and things like that. But if the use is going to be unsupervised, I don't think it is going to be any time before the age of 12 and that's when they are moving out and about a bit more freely. However, the type of smartphone that I think would be best suited for a 12 year old girl or boy is a smartphone that would not have any internet access."

They completely forget about their personal life, which not only affects them but also their family members and their friends that they are surrounded with. Um So uh this balance has to be uh it is difficult for them to find this balance because from the childhood, they haven't been balancing things correctly, maybe they are too much into playing or they forget about studies. So a person who can ball, who's been balancing both from childhood, that is their studies and their entertainment has uh will find it much easier to maintain their family, personal and work life. You can achieve this balance uh by making timetables, setting a time period of how much you should be working and what time you should give yourself uh to um to take a rest or go out enjoy with friends. Uh So this way you can manage your personal life and work life. You can also talk to people about how this can be achieved.

A lot of portion that needs to be covered will be covered in a short time span and then uh the students will just go by heart the same information and come on the exam here. In this case, it's not the students knowledge that is tested, it is their memory people. Uh not all, not everybody has great memory and that is not what needs to be tested here. So according to me, I think, uh whether be it oral or written, I would definitely prefer written exams. But what needs to be tested here is people's knowledge. So instead of rather giving, um rather making them write the same exact thing. A lot of different concepts needs to be tested. Even in oral exams, people need to be uh given the skills to talk in front of the class to give out their own, uh opinions out loud. Um, and a lot of uh debate competitions to be conducted where students can come in front openly and confidently talk about a lot of things this way, they will make them a better person and not just by heart, things is going to take them up in life. These are the things that needs to be brought into their lives too.

So in order to, for teenagers to make sure they get enough sleep, firstly, they should reduce their screen timing and uh focus more on calming themselves before going to sleep so that they tend to fall asleep much faster than being on their phones or watching movies because of which they don't get sleep. Um, there are, there have been a lot of cases where Children don't sleep enough and they, there are a lot of health problems that also occur because of this issue. So it is um encouraged that students should get at least eight hours of sleep every day in order to lead a healthy life and focus on their goals."

One is that a person stays in the same place and then the other is that they go to uh different places for a better life. I believe that the second option is better because personally, I think that uh you cannot grow to your full potential. When you are in one place you need to explore, you need uh to see different traditions and uh be around different people in order to uh truly know what you want to do in life. Uh For uh let me give some instances, for example, uh I am a student who's been studying in a certain area, but then my um like I'm doing my bachelors. So if I would want to do my masters, I want to go, I would want to go to another city or another country so that I can see how the education is there and uh accordingly uh decide what I want to do for my future. And I would also want to go to a place where I would have more employment opportunities. So if I would go abroad uh in my field Now, if I'm doing management, I would go to a field, uh, I would go to a place where I would have more exposure to businesses so that I would be able to, uh, give my level best and have a successful career.","Some of the qualities that I think that are important in a good supervisor is that uh they should uh be interested in team building. They should make sure that every person in their team, he knows the strengths of each of them and make sure that they work in an environment where one compliments the other. I also think that the boss should be patient with their, with his subordinates and he should also um give a platform for his subordinates to creatively pursue things. Uh I also think that um a boss should have good listening skills so that he can listen to all the problems of their subordinates and uh be able to help them grow. I chose all these qualities because I think that uh that is what I would want in a boss if I was ever working under uh a supervisor. Uh Why have I uh have I ever had a boss? That's like that I have had mentors in my life which have been uh striving to make sure that I come out of my shell and they find out what my strengths are like if it's speaking or if it's dancing, they've made sure that I explore it and then it uh it helps them in a hole also because uh it increases the productivity of an organization. So, yes, I have had such uh supervisors. I have, I've had such mentors and I'm happy that they have helped me come out of my shell.","Media in general is very important. So uh according to international media, uh obviously, every individual should know what's happening to the earth, not just in the country, they are. So I think it's very good and me as a student, I am in India right now, but I would want to know what's happening in the United States or in the UK because I would want to pursue my higher studies there. So I would want to know what uh what are the things that are happening? What are the economic developments that are happening in other countries? So I think international media is very important. So those also come under the advantages of international media is that as a student, I'll know how these countries are doing and disadvantage of international media is that uh um it does like, you know, when you hear about all the problems that are happening in certain countries, you obviously you don't want to uh go there or like also there's also misinformation in the international media, they don't tell the whole truth. So I think those are some of the disadvantages. Uh Do I follow media from other countries, countries? Uh I do, I do listen to the media from the US and the UK because those are some countries that I'm trying to pursue my, further my higher education for. So I would love to know what's happening there in a general point in a general, general standpoint.","OK, this is one of my favorite topics because I love libraries. I love reading books. I love the, I love that I can go to a good library and just switch off and actually, like, listen to my thoughts and learn a lot of new stuff that I didn't know before. So uh the future of libraries in the digital era, if I'm being honest, it's not looking good because um there's a lot of um things that are coming up, you can get a Kindle, which is basically you can get any books online. So there is like definitely no purpose for a library to be there. That's what people think and libraries don't get much business because of this, which is why they close down uh changing roles of academic libraries in the digital age. Uh I love the library in my college. I always go there. The changing roles is now, they have also uh adapted a lot of changes like they have brought uh when you enter, you have to scan your ID and then there's uh all the books are kept in a digital format. So it's easier to find these books. So I think those things are good because digital hand in hand with actual physical libraries, I think they can both go hand in hand. Uh The internet can't replace obviously the, the, the interaction because the librarians and the people in libraries, they help, they help with what you're like. Uh in order to uh if you tell them what you want, they will help you to go to certain sections where you can actually find it. And uh the library or some ways that the library can remain relevant is I think that they should adapt certain uh digital approaches too, like I said, um scanning books and then keeping them in a digital format so that it's easier to find them and then also for students to be able to find the books digitally. Uh Yeah. Thank you.","Some people are intrigued by antiques and ancient ancient monuments. So this is uh true. I have heard of a lot of uh people who love history. They are very interested in where they have come from, where we've originated from. Uh what has happened in the past that has made us what we are right now. So I think that uh people are intrigued by the past because uh of uh now, for example, the Taj Mahal, uh the fact that it's such a beauty, it's such an ancient monument, but it's still so beautiful and people keep coming and looking at it because of the story behind it and what um important, what an important thing it was for one person to dedicate this uh ancient monument to as a gift to his wife. There's a story behind that and the fact that people want to know what it's about. And it's also like uh having being in touch with your past in order to make sure what your identity is right now. And also in the future. Uh The next question, do you need to put special and effort into protecting ancient things? I agree because you need to respect your heritage because uh you need to be proud of where you came from. For example, I'm from India and India has a very rich heritage and there's a lot of temples, monuments like I said, the Taj Mahal. And I think all of that needs to be protected because that just shows where we come from and the values that we uh have as Indians. So I think that it's very important. Special effort is obviously, I want to make sure that we reserve it, we conserve it. And uh we make sure that in the future, our future, like we educate our future generations to also uh put an effort into uh conserving these monuments."

Uh, because it's going to be awkward for the, for the child. Um, that's it. Two, the most of the people. 12.

So they are, they give, uh, a limit of time to spend in their computer or smartphone, like one hour or one hour and a half and that things.","I think we have to learn about many subjects because if we just, er, focus in one subject, we are not going to learn things about the other subject.

Yes, I would, I would like to travel to the moon because it would be a very interesting experience. And although it would be very costly, it would be very expensive. I think that it would be worth it if I had the opportunity.","If a child commits a crime, then yes, I would think that the parents should punish it because it gives more of a punishment than just being thrown into prison or in jail or whatever I would say that it does matter what type of crime is committed, the stronger the crime, the worst, the punishment I would say.",I think that boys and girls should be in the same school. Why? Because that way you can meet more people of different genders and even became a partner of some sort like a boyfriend or a girlfriend. The bad parts of this would be that sometimes girls and boys can do some very bad stuff that is not appropriate for school and that would be one that would be punishable.,"I think that we have enough parks and gardens.

I, I walk with my, with my grandma and my, and my, and my aunt and, and parents, my mom, my sisters and my cousins. That was very beautiful. I, I also, and I also see a, a discovery that was amazing.

1685651809260553,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,"Well, something that I would do differently is to study harder in my vacation. And also throughout all the trimester of this year because I had a plan of studying really hard to improve my English. But I'm not doing it because I was lazy. And also because um there were a lot of homework. Uh Well, I, I think that's just an excuse. If I do want to study hard, I can't because I have a lot of time. So what would I do about it? I would probably just be hard, studying harder, studying more diligently from now on. And yeah, why would I do it? Um I would do it because I really, really want to uh get into a really good university. And another reason is that I want to be an inter, an interpreter. So I think it's important to improve my English. And yeah, how would it be different from what you did before or is a huge difference? So I think if I were practicing my spoken English and I were reading a lot of English article, I will practice in my writing and also I practice my listening, I wouldn't feel difficulty for this exam and I, I can get through this exam really easily and contently, but that's not what I am um feeling now. So I think it will, it will make a big difference if I've done things differently.","Well, I would say theaters because, uh, where I live or around there have to garden and also a museum now, but I'm not interested in museum. So I don't think, uh, they should have one and, yeah, because I don't like it all about theater. I, I'm kind of intrigued by theater because I will watch video feeling of people playing, um, the, uh, in the theater and I think it's quite well, it's not interesting but I think it's classic and it's beautiful. Um, what did I choose this or? Um, I just said it, I just mentioned it. So I'm not gonna repeat it again. How would it help people? What do you think of that? Um, how would it help you? I think it helps people to, I don't know, to probably let people feel the beauty of the theaters and just probably, um, the people have more leisure time spending on the theater instead of the, instead in the phones and, yeah.","Well, in my opinion, um the parents should be punished if a kid or if a child is committing a crime because uh as for me, um the parents have a, like they do have a lot of responsibility on educating the child to not commit any crime. And also the environment that parents give the kid could cause that the kid is going to commit a crime. So I think at some, at some point the parent has some responsibility on this. And also, oh, but another point is that I don't think they should be punished so severely like the punishment should go on the kid mainly instead of the parent because the kid is the one who committed a crime. Uh But well, that's my opinion doesn't matter what type of crime is committed. Well, I think it does because you were a murder then it's a really big deal. And I think uh well, yeah, and let me think, ok, I think it does matter because if you are just stealing, I think you should only punish uh the kids because it's not a big deal and that's something that everybody like everyone uh could do because of self inert, because they are envy about others. So it doesn't have, oh, I don't. Yeah, that's my opinion. And when, if you are a murderer then it's a really big deal. I think the reason that could cause a kid to commit a murder is probably the family.","Well, in my city, in my case, I didn't saw any system for recycling. But, well, because, well, I have seen a lot of trousers or trash. So, in the street and everything. So I didn't see any system for recycling in the cities. But I think what might encourage people to recycle is just to give them money because people in the city sort of like a, like money. Yeah. And another measure that could therapy is probably, um, put a lot of trash, trash can on the street and also advertising the importance of recycling and everything, or at least for what I have seen, there's, there's no any system for recycling in the city. So I think the basic thing is what the city could do in order to, uh, encourage people to recycle.","I think it's better for the kid and the child to study many surgery in the school because when you are convincing with other, you, you need to talk about other topic too. You're not like nobody is just going to be in touch with one topic and always talking about it. Like, and it also brings more diversity to our conversation, I would say. And, yeah. And, well, let's say that kids only studying what they want to study then I think, um, the knowledge of the kid is not going to be extensive and it's quite hard to get and it's quite hard to get a job if you know, just a lot of things. If, if you don't have a really, really extend knowledge, I don't know. That's why they think. And, yeah, that's my opinion."
